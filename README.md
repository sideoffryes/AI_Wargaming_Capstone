# Capstone Description

## Title: GenAI in Support of Wargaming

## Description

Creating believable, realistic, and immersive scenarios in support of wargaming objectives
requires significant time and subject matter expertise. This capstone project proposes developing a
software system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of critical wargaming
artifacts, such as "Road to War" briefs, concepts of operations, intelligence summaries, operational plans,
and operations orders. By utilizing an LLM system capable of generating detailed, context-specific
scenarios and associated products, this project aims to greatly accelerate the wargaming process,
potentially enhance the quality of the generated outputs, and reduce the need for extensive human resources.
The project may explore LLM techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and
prompt engineering, while also developing a user-friendly interface and ensuring real-time adaptability
based on user feedback. The final product will serve as a proof of concept, demonstrating how LLMs can
be harnessed to enhance and expedite the wargaming process.
