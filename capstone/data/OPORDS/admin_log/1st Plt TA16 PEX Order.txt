IV. ADMIN AND LOGISTICS.
        A. Administration.
                1. Casualties. Co Corpsman will be located at the company CP, which will be established IVO LZ Peregrine, 18S TH 856 747.  All PLs will generate a CASEVAC plan that takes their casualty to the closest road/trail or LZ.  Any routine casualties that can continue with the mission should do so and be treated upon extract.  Any urgent/priority casualties will be called to the company CP where CASEVAC link-up point will be arranged.  Expect a mobile element, most likely the Bn CAAT to conduct pick-up for priority casualties within 15 minutes of receiving the report.  Expect all urgent casualties to have simultaneous request for Bn CAAT and air CASEVAC.
                2. EPWs. All EPWs taken by patrols will be returned to the company CP for tactical questioning and to be processed to higher echelons.  Detainment authority up to (6) hours lies with any detachment leader (in our case, patrol leaders) and holding longer than (6) hours requires a company commanderâ€™s approval.  Ensure that any EPWs/detainees that are taken have actionable evidence that will allow them to be held for further processing.  Treat all with STRESS.
        B. Logistics.  PLs will ensure that all Marines step off w/ four quarts of water and one DOS of chow.
