Orientation.  Company F is located in an AA IVO MOUT Town at TH 794 727. Our company AO boundaries are as follows: MCB-3 to our SW, MCB-6 to our SE, Tokyo Road to our W, Route 645 to our E, and the 74 Northing to our N. Note that the AO is boundary-inclusive. The terrain is Quantico-like with many fingers and draws that vary from 200 to 400 meters in elevation. Vegetation is primarily medium-growth deciduous forest with some coniferous representation. Key terrain within our AO includes several MSRs/ASRs, including Tokyo Road (N-S), MCB 5 (NW-SE), and Dirt-6 (SW-NE). The now friendly-controlled village of MOUT-town lies within our AO and will serve as our company AA. Numerous LZs are within our AO, including LZ Egret (TH 783 725), LZ Cardinal (TH 797 729), LZ Kiwi (TH 795 722), and LZ Buzzard (TH 806 727). Tactical control measures in our AO include the Assembly Area, PRP (TH 795 730), Co Aslt Pos (TH 799 736), BN Obj 1 (TH 825 745), BN Obj 2 (TH 803 736), and Co Obj A (TH 801 726). There are numerous intermittent streams throughout our AO, primarily running N-S in accordance with the draws that open to the northern end of the AO. Extensive trail networks criss-cross our AO; however, most of these trails run IVO of the LZs or parallel to the existing MSRs. The off-road terrain is unrestricted for foot-mobile infantry, but severely restricted for all vehicle traffic. Improved roads are unrestricted for vehicles. The unimproved roads within the AO are unrestricted for vehicles dependent upon weather. During heavy precipitation, the unimproved roads may become restricted to severely restricted. Visibility is dependent upon the season. In summer months, visibility is approximately 250m from the high ground and 25-50m inside of the draws. In winter months, visibility increases to approximately 400-500m from the high ground, and 50m within the draws. Illumination will be 25-30% in hours of darkness. Weather is as it is today.
