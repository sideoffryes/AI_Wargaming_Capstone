ORIENTATION.  The platoon’s AO is bounded to the south by MCB-1, Route 646 to the north, the 84 Easting to the west and 619 to the east.  The terrain is typical to the Centralian Highland region and is generally not as steep as the southern regions of the country.  The terrain is broken with numerous fingers and draws especially near water features.  This will create numerous cross compartmental danger areas.  There are numerous creeks, with the two main ones being South Fork and Quantico Creek which bisect the AO from NW to SE.  Route 618 bisects our AO from north to south, and there are numerous trail networks throughout the AO creating linear danger areas.  There are eleven LZ’s in the AO however not all have been surveyed and may not be useable for all aircraft types.  There are also areas which have been partially opened by bombing and burned by incendiaries and are restrictive to foot mobile forces.  The vegetation is thick and visibility is normally restricted to 50-100m, sometimes less than 10m in the low areas.  Off road traffic is generally no go for wheeled and tracked vehicles and slow go for foot mobile troops.
