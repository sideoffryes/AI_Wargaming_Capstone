General Situation.  You are the # Platoon Commander, Echo Company, 2nd Battalion 7th Marines.  You are currently aboard the USS Bataan serving as the helicopter company of Battalion Landing Team (BLT) for 2nd Battalion 7th Marines.  Co F 2/7 and BLT 2/7 are currently located on separate ships in our Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG), all located off the southwest Coast of Upshur Island.  The MRA has recently sent an additional Company (+) to Upshur Island after our recent successes there.  Their endstate is to reinforce, reorganize, and conduct offensive operations on Quantico Island.
BLT 2/7 has been tasked with clearing the enemy on the Upshur Island IOT prevent the enemy from seizing Port Upshur and regaining control of the Centralian Islands.  The MEB commander intends to clear the island utilizing BLT 2/7 to conduct distributed patrolling and offensive operations. To set conditions for the BLT operations, he intends to utilize the helicopter company, Co K, in order to gain a foothold and establish initial security on the island and facilitate a strong logistical route from Port Upshur.


Orientation.  We are currently on board the USS Bataan just off of the Southwest coast of Upshur Island.  The AO boundaries are as follows:
-      North- MCB 8
-      East- Hangman Tree Rd
-      South- 74N
-      West- Rte 645
Terrain/Vegetation: Terrain consists of rolling hills, and intermittent streams in low lying areas. There is mostly thin vegetation in pockets of the region, but is vastly covered with dense vegetation.  During the summer months, vegetation significantly reduces visibility from 200 – 300 meters on high ground to100 – 200 meters in low ground and around streams. During the winter, observation can reach 400 – 500 meters in high ground, due to the lack of foliage.  Hills vary in elevation up to 30 meters, which can canalize and result in slow movement. The AO has many streams and creeks, all of which are fordable on foot, but will slow movement significantly. Weather is similar to our previous operations in the area.


Major Roads:  There are several major roads in the AO: MCB 1, 5, 6, 8, RTE 609, RTE 618, RTE 645, RTE 646, and Hangman Tree Rd.  These roads are considered to be unrestricted to vehicular traffic. The MRA does not currently utilize these roads as a result of our shaping fires; which had devastating effects against MRA convoys. The trafficability of the trails on the map are unknown at this time.
