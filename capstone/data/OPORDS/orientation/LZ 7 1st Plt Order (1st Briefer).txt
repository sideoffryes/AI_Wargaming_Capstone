Orientation.  Our Area of Operations (AO) is bordered by MCB-3 to the East and North, 84 Easting (parallel to Route 643) to the West, and Aquia Creek to the South.  We are currently located in LZ 7, which serves as our company’s Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) and assembly area, as well as a UN logistics hub. Off-road travel is restricted for vehicles and unrestricted for dismounts.   Surrounding areas are characterized by dense vegetation, numerous draws ranging 20 – 50 meters in depth.  Water frequently occupies the base of the draws after periods of rain, but may not be depicted on our maps. Observation: Visibility ranges from 50-200m during the winter months and 25-100m during summer months. Cover & Concealment: Heavily vegetated areas provide the most concealment for movement, while some low lying areas around Aquia Creek are lightly vegetated and provide enhanced visibility for us and the enemy. Numerous fingers and draws can facilitate cover for movement depending on our direction of travel. Obstacles: Aquia Creek is not normally fordable during the winter months but an adjacent company has reported several positions where foot mobile traffic can cross, although none have been identified in our Company AO as of now. Key Terrain: LZ 7, our assembly area, provides a staging area and distribution center for UN supplies, and therefore is a high priority for MRA forces. Several clearings in surrounding areas are potentially suitable for use as helicopter landing zones for resupply, casualty and EPW evacuation purposes. Avenues of Approach: All unimproved roads are trafficable by both friendly and enemy forces and can also be utilized in conjunction with the MSRs for resupply, casualty and EPW evacuation purposes. Due to lighter vegetation and moderate terrain along water features, dismounted enemy avenues of approach are likely along guiding features such as Aquia Creek.  Potable water sources are available throughout the AO.
