3. (U) Execution


    a. (U) Commanders Intent.  


        (1) (U) Purpose. The purpose of this operation is to allow the company to stage for follow-on operations in support of BLT-2/7.


        (2) (U) Method. The enemy’s center of gravity is their defense in depth with LP/OPs and squad sized units forward of the defensive battle positions. His critical vulnerability is his inability to mutually support all positions and conduct lateral communication. We will exploit this critical vulnerability by conducting simultaneous attacks on enemy platoon positions.


        (3) (U) Endstate. MRA defensive positions are destroyed and are prevented from conducting resupply operations.  Friendly forces are prepared to conduct follow on offensive operations.


    b. (U) Concept of Operations


1. (U) Scheme of Maneuver.  Direction of Attack will be Counter-Clockwise for the Company. We will have (1) ME and (3) SEs and will conduct simultaneous platoon attacks. At 1000, our company will conduct air insert to LZ Vulture (ME), LZ Snipe (SE1), and LZ Canary (SE2). Platoons will establish ORPs IVO of TH 830 777 (ME), TH 831 765 (SE1), and TH 845 772 (SE2) and conduct leader’s reconnaissance on assigned objectives. ME will attack LZ Snipe (CO OBJ A).  SE1 will attack LZ Canary (CO OBJ B).  SE2 will attack LZ Vulture (CO OBJ C). Platoons will attack assigned objectives via route of their choosing. Platoons will stage main packs at insert LZs. Actions on objective will be complete NLT 1400. 


        (2) (U) Fire Support Plan.  


            (a) (U) Task. Limit the enemy’s ability to maneuver in and around the objective


            (b) (U) Purpose. Allow the maneuver to close with and destroy the enemy on the company objectives.  


            (c) (U) Method. We will use the battalion’s 81mm mortars and the company’s 60mm mortars in support of this attack.  POF 81s is to ME, SE2, and SE1. POF for 60s is SE1, ME, SE2.  Platoon Commanders are allocated three targets for your attack on your respective objectives. Company Target Block: 1st Plt:AD1100-1195, 3d Plt:AD3100-3195, 5th Plt:AD5100-5195.
            (d). (U) Effects. Enemy on objectives suppressed to allow the maneuver element to close within direct fire weapons systems effective ranges and establish support by fire positions.
