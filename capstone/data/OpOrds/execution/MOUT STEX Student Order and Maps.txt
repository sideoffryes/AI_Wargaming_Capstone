3. Execution


   6. Commander’s Intent  


      10. Purpose.  To allow G and F Companies to conduct forward passage of lines into MOUT Town and destroy the CRF Company (-)(+) located there. 


      11. Method.  The enemy's COG is their prepared defensive positions, specifically the engagement areas S and W along MSR Tampa. Their CV is their inability to be rapidly reinforced. I intend to exploit this by rapidly conducting sequential platoon attacks. We will first seize the buildings to the E of MSR Tampa to eliminate the western engagement area.  We will then seize all buildings to the W of MSR Tampa IOT seize all of MOUT Town.  


      12. End State.  Destruction of the CRF platoon and their ability to interfere with the ME attack on Combat  Town while still preserving the local infrastructure for follow on operations and handover back to the civilian populace. 


   7. Concept of Operations 


      13. Scheme of Maneuver.  DOA is north. The company will conduct a frontal attack with one Plt (+) as Security Unit, one Plt (+) as the Support Unit, and one Plt (+) as the Assault Unit. This will be a three-stage operation. All Units BPT TO ROTATE and fill the roles of Security, Support, and Assault. 


         7. Stage A: Seizure of Co Obj A.  
-Begins with: the Security Unit isolating Obj B West of the MSR, which sets conditions for the Assault Unit to Seize Co Obj A. 
-Ends With: Seizure of Co Obj A, the Assault Unit will immediately transition Security Unit to provide isolation of Co Obj B.  
-Critical Events: 
                             Assault Unit Clears from PL Cranberry to PL Banana. 
                             Assault Unit Seizes Co Obj A. 
                             Support Unit Follows in Support
-Conditions Set: Isolate Co Obj B IOT allow Stage B Assault Unit to Seize Co Obj B




         8. Stage B: Seizure of Co Obj B.  
-Begins with: Security Unit isolating Co Obj B from Co Obj A which sets conditions for the Assault Unit to Seize Co Obj B. 
-Ends With: Seizure of Co Obj B, Assault will immediately transition to Security to providing isolation on Co Obj B.   
-Critical Events: Assault Unit Clears from Phase Line Banana to Phase Line Apple. 
                             Assault Unit Seizes Co Obj B 
                             Support Unit Follows in Support 
-Conditions Set: Isolate Co Obj C IOT allow Stage C Assault to Seize Co Obj C. 


         9. Stage C: Seizure of Co Obj C. 
-Begins with: Security Unit isolating Co Obj C, which sets conditions for the Assault Unit to Seize Co Obj C.  
- Ends with: Co Obj C Seized by the Assault Unit, all units will transition to security in order to allow for Bn Forward Passage of Line.  
-Critical Events: 
                             Assault Unit Clears from Phase Line Banana to Co Obj C
                             Assault Unit Seizes Company Obj C
                             Assault, Support, and Security Consolidate N Side of MOUT Town in 360 defensive
                             perimeter.   
                             Assault oriented to the N, Support to the E/SE, and Security to the W/SW. 
-Conditions Set:  Conduct Bn Forward Passage of Lines.
