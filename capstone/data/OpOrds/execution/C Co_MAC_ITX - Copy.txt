Commanderâ€™s Intent:
Tasks: Clear in zone, Defend in sector
Purpose: Gain control of the Prospect Delta, Deny enemy use of the Prospect Delta AoA
Method: We will sequentially isolate and seize each objective through a combined arms flanking 
attack from north to south.  
Endstate : Enemy forces cleared from Prospect Delta, key terrain within the Prospect Delta 
controlled, friendly forces prepared for follow on operations.

and enemy mechanized platoon on Obj1
8)81s moves to MFP 1 IVO NU 892 005
9)Establishment of 81s, CAAT, and FiST positions ends Phase I
Conditions set prior to moving to Phase II:
-Enemy CSOP destroyed
-CAAT screening North
-81s firecapped at MFP 1
-FiST established IVO 00 Northing
Casevac plan: Establish hasty LZ for extract for Urgent casualties, following destruction of CSOP 
establish LZ at NT 890 975.
