Situation :
Composition/Disposition/Strengths:
One mechanized infantry company occupies defensive 
positions in the PROSPECT -DELTA corridor.  The company is 
suspected to be equipped with BMP -2Ms and BRDM -2Ms 
with AT -5 ATGMs and dismounted troops with AT -5s and SA -
16 MANPADs. Specific unit defensive positions are unknown, 
but they are templated to have mutually supported fortified 
positions covering obstacles. Additionally, the enemy 
typically employs a forward combat security outpost for 
early warning and to delay attacking forces. The security 
elements are equipped with BRDM -2Ms, AT -5 ATGMs, and 
are suspected to occupy a position at NT899 997 in the 
PROSPECT -DELTA corridor. 
Capabilities/Limitations:
Defend: Likely, will use the OP to AF/FFE on formations as 
they approach the obstacles. Obstacles and IDF will fix 
formations to be destroyed with direct fire. 
Reinforce: Unlikely, Reinforcements from their HHQ are likely 
within 24 hours
Attack: Spoiling attack possible and limited offensive 
operations from a defensive position to gain time 
Withdraw: Unlikely 
Delay: Likely 
EMLCOA: Defend in place until reinforcements can arrive 
from the company to the north.
EMDCOA: Enemy conducts a spoiling attack prior to us 
reaching the objective.
Center of Gravity: Fortified defense in depth with natural 
and man made obstacles
Critical Vulnerability: Lack of mobility in their fixed 
positions. Mechanized Recon PlatoonMechanized Infantry PlatoonMechanized Infantry Platoon
Medium AT Missile launcher

Mission :
T1: At H-Hour, clear in zone in order to gain control of the PROSPECT -DELTA avenue of 
approach. 
T2: O/O, Defend in sector in order to deny the enemy use of the PROSPECT -DELTA avenue of 
approach. BPT conduct a counter attack to the North.
Execution:
Commander’s Intent:
Tasks: Clear in zone, Defend in sector
Purpose: Gain control of the Prospect Delta, Deny enemy use of the Prospect Delta AoA
Method: We will sequentially isolate and seize each objective through a combined arms flanking 
attack from north to south.  
Endstate : Enemy forces cleared from Prospect Delta, key terrain within the Prospect Delta 
controlled, friendly forces prepared for follow on operations.
