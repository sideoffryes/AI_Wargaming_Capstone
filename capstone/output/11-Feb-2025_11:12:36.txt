                                                                        OpOrd Alpha-1


General Situation.  You are the Platoon Commander, Company A, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines.  The USS Bataan is currently located off the Southwest coast of Upshur Island.  We have been tasked with conducting a reconnaissance-in-force (RIF) on the USS Naval Academy, located in Annapolis, Maryland.  The MEB commander intends to conduct a follow-on operation to clear the Naval Academy of enemy forces.  We are to provide supporting fire and conduct a secure and efficient assault on the Naval Academy.  The Naval Academy is located approximately 30 miles off the coast of Annapolis.


Orientation.  The Naval Academy is located on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay.  The AO boundaries are as follows:
-      North- 40 Northing
-      East- 75 Westing
-      South- 38 Northing
-      West- 80 Westing
Terrain/Vegetation: Terrain consists of rolling hills, and intermittent streams in low lying areas. There is mostly thin vegetation in pockets of the region, but is vastly covered with dense vegetation.  During the summer months, vegetation significantly reduces visibility from 200 – 300 meters on high ground to100 – 200 meters in low ground and around streams. During the winter, observation can reach 400 – 500 meters in high ground, due to the lack of foliage.  Hills vary in elevation up to 30 meters, which can canalize and result in slow movement. The AO has many streams and creeks, all of which are fordable on foot, but will slow movement significantly. Weather is as it is today.


Major Roads:  There are several major roads in the AO:  US-50, US-301, and the Annapolis Bridge.  These roads are considered to be unrestricted to vehicular traffic. The MRA does not currently utilize these roads as a result of our shaping fires; which had devastating effects against MRA convoys. The trafficability of the trails on the map are unknown at this time.


The following LZ’s are capable to support air CASEVAC’s and air resupply (All other LZ’s are considered unsupportable for air CASEVAC and air resupply):
-      LZ Eagle (TH 829791)
-      LZ Pheasant (TH 821779)
-      LZ Vulture (TH 829779)
-      LZ Drake (TH 805766)
-      LZ Tern (TH 810759)
-      LZ Crane (TH 828754)
-      LZ Duck (TH 823745)
-      LZ Canary (TH 845769)
-      LZ Fazica (TH 861758)
-      LZ Snipe (TH 829764) 


The Naval Academy is a large complex with multiple buildings, including the Naval Academy Chapel, the Naval Academy Museum, and the Naval Academy Stadium.  The Naval Academy is surrounded by a high wall and has multiple layers of security.  The Naval Academy is currently unoccupied by enemy forces, but we expect the MRA to attempt to occupy the Naval Academy in the near future.


1. (U) Situation


    a. (U) Enemy


        (1) (U) Composition/Disposition/Strength.  Throughout the last 48 hours the MRA have been reinforced at Upshur Island.   S-2 assessments indicate the MRA will reinforce to a Company (+) size. The MRA are known to wear camouflage uniforms and protective armor.  They typically wear US style utilities in both woodland and desert varieties.  Often, they do not match their pattern to the season/foliage.  The MRA forces are currently re-consolidating to conduct offensive operations to regain a foothold after their recent defeats by coalition forces on the island. The MRA are located within RTE 645, MCB 1, MCB 8, and Hangman Tree Rd at, establishing defensive positions in preparation for reinforcements to arrive on island. They are carrying US style small arms to include M4/M16 rifles, M240 medium machine guns, and possess night vision capabilities. Additionally, they have 81mm mortar assets, but their locations are unknown at this time. They have complex communication capabilities, allowing them communication across their entire AO, and the ability to coordinate with their 81mm mortars. They are known to have basic proficiency with their mortars and can usually achieve effects on target with minimal adjustments. The enemy has not been seen using hardball roads and identifiable trails due to superiority of our close air support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets.  Instead, friendly patrols and human intelligence reporting indicates the enemy primarily uses natural

A Group


General Situation.  You are the _____ Platoon Commander, Company E (+), BLT 2/7.  Company E (+) will insert as the lead element of the battalion, followed immediately by additional indirect fire support assets with a security element.  Battalion will insert follow on forces once Co G has destroyed the enemy IVO the logistical hub.
Orientation.  We are currently on board the USS Bataan position off of the Southwest coast of Upshur Island.  The BLT AO boundaries are as follows:
-      North- 79 Northing
-      East- N Hangman Tree Road
-      South- 75 Northing
-      West- SR 609


Terrain/Vegetation: Terrain consists of rolling hills, and intermittent streams in low lying areas. There is mostly thin vegetation in pockets of the region, but is vastly covered with dense vegetation.  During the summer months, vegetation significantly reduces visibility from 200 – 300 meters on high ground to100 – 200 meters in low ground and around streams.

Major Roads:  There are several major roads in the AO: SR 609 and N Hangman Tree Road.  These roads are unrestricted to vehicular traffic.  There is also 16E Tank Trail running from East to West and is restricted to vehicular traffic. As a result of our shaping fires, which had devastating effects against MRA convoys, the MRA minimizes its use along these roads to singular or double transport vehicles capable of carrying a medium machine gun. The traffic-ability of the trails on the map are currently unknown.

1. (U) Situation


    a. (U) Enemy


        (1) (U) Composition/Disposition/Strength.  During the past 24 hours, collection assets have reported that the MRA Company is establishing Area Defense with Platoon Battle Positions in order to prevent U.S. Forces from disrupting their offensive operations on Upshur Island. Our specific Company Objectives are as follows: Co Obj A (IVO TH 830 767), Co Obj B (IVO TH 844 769), and Co Obj C (IVO TH 830 778).  Imagery has shown the MRA has small command and control sites IVO of all Company Objectives. The S-2 has determined through reports from inserted scout sniper teams that the MRA are establishing a defense in depth by conducting patrols and ambushes along avenues of approach forward of the platoon battle positions. The MRA units were seen wearing various camouflage uniforms, and appear armed with U.S. small arms to include M4/M16 rifles, M240 medium machine guns and medium (81mm) mortars. The S-2 assesses that the MRA have reliable communications assets and can call for indirect fires. The MRA also appear to have night vision and thermal capabilities.  


        (2) (U) Capabilities and Limitations.             


            (a) (U) Defend: The MRA is capable of conducting up to a company sized sector defense through coordinated individual platoon battle positions.  They are capable of conducting a defense in depth through emplacing LP/OPs, conducting patrols and integrating fires into their engagement area. They are limited in their ability to move freely throughout the AO because they commit all of their forces to establishing defensive positions rather than dedicating units to a reserve. 


            (b) (U) Reinforce: The MRA is capable of reinforcing their defensive positions internally with patrolling MRA squads within 30 minutes.  They are limited in their ability to reinforce, by their lack of ability to receive timely and accurate information which indicate approaching forces equal or outnumber their established defensive positions. 


            (c) (U) Attack:  The MRA are capable of conducting harassing attacks through establishing fire team to squad size ambush positions along trails and roads. The MRA is limited in their ability to attack as a result of committing their forces to static defensive battle positions.


            (d) (U) Withdraw: The MRA is capable of withdrawing along roads and trails as a result of their mobile patrols.  They are limited in their ability to withdraw quickly while carrying their wounded and killed.  They are limited by the speed of which they can withdraw because they have minimal vehicle assets. 


            (e) (U) Delay: The MRA is capable of delaying our forces with indirect fires, patrolling operations and established engagement areas.  The enemy is capable of using its patrols and LP/OPs to identify our position in order to call for fire or establish ambush positions. They are limited by their poor communication ability between their units and their limited intelligence assets.


        (3) (U) Enemy Most Likely Course of Action.  The MRA company’s mission is to protect the command and control sites located IVO LZs Vulture, Snipe, and Canary IOT allow offensive operations in our AO.  Currently, the company is establishing Platoon Battle Positions Southwest of LZ Vulture, North of LZ Snipe, and West of LZ Canary. They will likely establish depth by conducting squad sized ambush patrols along likely avenues of approach and security patrols in order to provide early warning of the presence of US forces.  They will utilize LP/OP positions forward of their defensive positions in an effort to extend their observation.  On contact, the MRA patrols will attempt to disrupt our movement to provide the MRA forces additional time to prepare their defensive positions.  Once their planned withdrawal routes are threatened, the MRA squads will withdraw via the most direct route and link up with their established defensive positions in their sector.  The MRA platoon battle positions will defend in depth, utilizing indirect fires observed by the LP/OP or patrolling force, once our forces are identified.  Once our forces enter their engagement area, they will engage with their direct fire weapons attempting to mass their fires on our maneuver element.  The defensive positions will not withdraw in force once in contact due to the importance of the command and control sites and their inability to return to their native country of Montanya.


    b. (U) Friendly


        (1) (U) Higher’s Mission and Intent.  


1. Mission. ME, NLT 1400, 2/7 destroys the MRA command and control sites in order to prevent MRA forces from conducting coordinated offensive operations in our AO.


2. Commander’s Intent:  All MRA forward and main battle positions destroyed. MRA prevented from conducting coordinated offensive operations and returning to the Island of Quantico; thereby preventing the MRA from disrupting Centralian Government operations.  Friendly forces are in control of LZ Vulture, LZ Canary, and LZ Snipe and prepared to receive follow on forces.


        (2) (U) Adjacent


            (a) (U) Fox Co.  NLT 0930, secure LZ Crane IOT allow Bn 81mm Mortar platoon to occupy a mortar firing position.  
        (3) (U) Supporting.  


            (a) (U) Bn 81mm Mortars. Wpns Co, 81mm Mortar Platoon is in DS of Company E and will land IVO LZ Crane.  POF are to ME, SE1, SE2, SE3.


            (b). (U) Attachments/Detachments. None.

        (1) (U) Purpose. The purpose of this operation is to allow the company to stage for follow-on operations in support of BLT-2/7.


        (2) (U) Method. The enemy’s center of gravity is their defense in depth with LP/OPs and squad sized units forward of the defensive battle positions. His critical vulnerability is his inability to mutually support all positions and conduct lateral communication. We will exploit this critical vulnerability by conducting simultaneous attacks on enemy platoon positions.


        (3) (U) Endstate. MRA defensive positions are destroyed and are prevented from conducting resupply operations.  Friendly forces are prepared to conduct follow on offensive operations.


    b. (U) Concept of Operations


1. (U) Scheme of Maneuver.  Direction of Attack will be Counter-Clockwise for the Company. We will have (1) ME and (3) SEs and will conduct simultaneous platoon attacks. At 1000, our company will conduct air insert to LZ Vulture (ME), LZ Snipe (SE1), and LZ Canary (SE2). Platoons will establish ORPs IVO of TH 830 777 (ME), TH 831 765 (SE1), and TH 845 772 (SE2) and conduct leader’s reconnaissance on assigned objectives. ME will attack LZ Snipe (CO OBJ A).  SE1 will attack LZ Canary (CO OBJ B).  SE2 will attack LZ Vulture (CO OBJ C). Platoons will attack assigned objectives via route of their choosing. Platoons will stage main packs at insert LZs. Actions on objective will be complete NLT 1400. 


        (2) (U) Fire Support Plan.  


            (a) (U) Task. Limit the enemy’s ability to maneuver in and around the objective


            (b) (U) Purpose. Allow the maneuver to close with and destroy the enemy on the company objectives.  


            (c) (U) Method. We will use the battalion’s 81mm mortars and the company’s 60mm mortars in support of this attack.  POF 81s is to ME, SE2, and SE1. POF for 60s is SE1, ME, SE2.  Platoon Commanders are allocated three targets for your attack on your respective objectives. Company Target Block: 1st Plt:AD1100-1195, 3d Plt:AD3100-3195, 5th Plt:AD5100-5195.

                                                                                 PLT O STEX 
 
General Situation.  You are the 2d Platoon Commander, Company E, 2d Battalion, 7th Marines (2/7). Over the last two weeks, 2/7 has been conducting offensive operations to counter the MRA’s attempts to interdict the Centralian Army’s MSRs in the Quantico Highlands. The battalion has been advancing primarily in a northeastern direction. Two days ago, a Centralian Army Regular (CAR) platoon operating a vital communications facility (TH 053 731) defected and is now directly aligned with the MRA. This newly-defected MRA platoon now operates the communications facility in support of MRA operations. The Centralian government’s ability to communicate throughout the Quantico Highlands is severely degraded with the loss of the communication facility.     
 
Orientation.  Co E is currently located in the Company Assembly Area (TH 054 711), located on the SW side of Cedar Ridge. The Company Attack Position (TH 062 711) is located on the SE side of Cedar Ridge, and the Line of Departure follows the military crest of Cedar Ridge along the 712-Northing. The Main Effort’s Assault Position (TH 063 733) is located on the NE side of Hill 430. The vegetation in the Quantico Highlands consists of medium growth hardwood deciduous and evergreen trees with occasional open fields and several hills. Hill 464 (062 723) provides good observation on Hill 419. Hill 419 (TH 058 728) is identified as Co Obj A. The MRA communications facility (TH 053 732), identified as Bn Obj 1 is located 250m East of Hill 420. Visibility is limited to 500m from the high ground, 200m in the low ground and reduced to 50m within densely wooded areas. Terrain is unrestricted for foot-mobile infantry, but vehicle movement is restricted to Hidalgo Road, which runs from southwest to northeast through the northern portion of our AO. Weather is as it is today. Illumination will be restricted to 0% during the hours of dusk until 0100. Moonrise will be at 0100, after which illumination will be upwards of 40%. Tactical control measures within the AO include the Co AA, the Co Atk Pos, the LD, the Platoon Release Point (TH 064 713), the ME Aslt Pos, Co Obj A (TH 058 728), and Bn Obj 1. Target AB1001, on Bn Obj 1, is included in the order. 
 
1. (U) Situation 
 
    a. (U) Enemy 
 
      1. (U) Composition/Disposition/Strength.  The MRA platoon (defected CAR platoon) is providing security for the facility and is believed to be occupying defensive positions on high ground surrounding the facility. At 0200 this morning, a squad-size force was seen preparing defensive positions on Hill 419 (TH 058 728). It is not known where the rest of the MRA platoon(-) is located. The enemy is armed with U.S. small arms and wears woodland camouflage uniforms. Additionally, they are known to have M240B machine guns and 81mm mortars. 
 
      2. (U) Capabilities and Limitations.  The enemy is capable of defending from battle positions with as little as a squad sized element and can coordinate direct and indirect fires in support of their defensive operations. They are limited by a lack of mutual support between squad positions. They are capable of reinforcing with an additional platoon within 30 minutes and would do so once they believe they are in a decisive engagement but are limited by the distance between adjacent units. The MRA are capable of attacking in up to squad sized elements if they have advantageous terrain but are limited due to their desire to remain close to the comm facility.  They are capable of withdrawing via Hidalgo Road in either direction. They are limited by their inability to move quickly in the terrain South of Hidalgo Road. They are capable of delaying through the employment of coordinated direct and indirect fires. They are limited by the dense vegetation which results in limited sightlines to develop early warning.
 
      3. (U) Enemy Most Likely Course of Action.  I believe that the EN’s mission is to guard the communications facility in order to allow the MRA to coordinate small unit efforts and the use of indirect fires. Currently, the EN is establishing a defense in depth oriented southwest along the MSR. On contact, the MRA platoon will fiercely defend the Communications Facility. They will fight to gain time using a squad sized forward position, disrupting our attack formations along the MSR IOT allow additional forces time to reinforce the main battle position at the communications facility. They will reinforce the Communications Facility with an additional platoon from the northeast by truck via Hidalgo Road as soon as the on scene platoon commander determines that the forward squad is decisively engaged. The reinforcements will initially focus efforts on reinforcing the forward squad to continue to disrupt our attack and then shift their efforts/remainder of forces to reinforcing around the communications facility to retain the facility. 
 
    b. (U) Friendly 
 
         1. (U) Higher’s Mission and Intent.  O/O, 2/7 seizes the communications facility (Bn Obj 1) in order to allow the Centralian government to resume communications with the local populace throughout the Quantico Highlands.  The battalion commander’s desired endstate is that the battalion regains and returns control and use of the communications facility to the Centralian government, and the MRA in zone is unable to interfere with the government’s ability to communicate throughout the Quantico Highlands. 
 
         2. (U) Adjacent 
 
         1. (U) West.  Co G. (SE1) NLT 1430, block West of Hill 419 (about 2 km off the W side of the sand table) along Hidalgo Road in order to prevent CRF reinforcements from interfering with the main effort’s attack. 
 
         2. (U) South.  Bn Log trains (SE3) NLT 1430, establish CSS logistics staging areas IVO B AA (about 1 km off the S side of the sand table) in order to allow logistics resupply of forward units. 
 
         3. (U) North.  None 
 
         4. (U) East.  Co F. (SE2) NLT 1430, block East of Hill 419 (about 500m just off the E side of the sand table) along Hidalgo Road in order to prevent CRF reinforcements from interfering with the main effort’s attack. 
 
        (3) (U) Supporting. 
 
         1. (U) Artillery.  Kilo Battery 3/11. DS of the battalion. K/3/11 is located 5 km South of Cedar Ridge in GP Pelican (TH 063 665). POF: Echo, Golf, Fox. 
 
         2. (U) Bn 81mm Mortars.  81mm Mortar Platoon. GS of the battalion. The mortar platoon is located at the battalion’s AA 1 km south of Cedar Ridge at 050 700. POF: Echo, Golf, Fox.
 
    c. (U) Attachments/Detachments.  None 
 
2. (U) Mission.  We are the ME for the BN. NLT 1500, Company E seizes the communications facility (Bn Obj 1) in order to allow the Centralian government to resume communications with the local populace throughout the Quantico Highlands. 
 
3. (U) Execution 
 
      1. (U) Commander’s Intent.  The purpose of this operation is to allow the Centralian government to resume communications with the local populace throughout the Quantico Highlands. The enemy’s Center of Gravity is their prepared defense in-depth with the ability to coordinate direct and indirect fires established around the communications facility. The Critical Vulnerability is that as a result of this defense in depth, they have split forces and are no longer able to mutually support positions with direct fire weapons. We will exploit this CV by conducting a conditions based sequential (near simultaneous) attack on the defensive positions to generate tempo and overwhelm forces before they can reinforce or coordinate indirect fire support. My endstate is that the communications facility is seized and returned to Centralian government control enabling their ability to resume communications with the local populace in the Quantico Highlands, the enemy no longer has any influence on the comm facility or surrounding area, and the company is consolidated at the communications facility, prepared for follow on operations. 
 
      2. (U) Concept of Operations 
 
                        (1) (U) Scheme of Maneuver.  We will conduct a flanking attack with one ME, two SE. DOA is North. We will move from the AA to the Atk Pos in a company column (SE2,ME-SE1), crossing the LD at the Platoon Release Point (PRP). From the PRP, SE 1 will move along an independent route and destroy the enemy in vic of Hill 419 (Co Obj A) which will set conditions for the ME attack on Bn Obj1. The company(-) will continue N in a column (SE2-ME) along the E side of Hill 464 to the Company Aslt Pos (NE side of Hill 430), where we will transition to an online formation (ME-SE1). Once SE #1 destroys the enemy on Co Obj A, the Weapons Platoon Commander will call for 5 minutes of indirect fire suppression on Bn Obj 1. Upon effective suppression of the enemy from IDF on the objective, the ME and SE #2 will seize Bn Obj 1 assaulting from East to West. On signal, the company will consolidate on the objective in a 180 degree perimeter oriented north (ME from 8-12 o’clock, SE2 from 12-4 o’clock). On signal, SE 1 will displace and link up with the rest of the company on the objective, with ME from 8-12 o’clock, SE2 from 12-4 o’clock, SE1 from 4-8 o’clock. 
 
                        (2) (U) Fire Support Plan.   
 
         1. (U) Task.  Limit the enemy’s ability to employ direct and indirect fire weapon systems on Company Objective A and Battalion Objective 1. 
 
         2. (U) Purpose.  IOT allow to maneuver elements to close with and destroy the enemy on Battalion Objective 1 and Co Obj A. 
 
         3. (U) Method.   
 
            1. (U) I will use the battalion’s 81mm mortars and the company’s 60mm mortars in support of this attack for the ME and SE2. Co FiST leader will develop TTLODAC for ME attack on Bn Objective 1. 
            2. (U) 2d Platoon commander submit your TTLODAC for the attack on Company Objective A. You are allotted two targets. Submit your list of targets to the company FiST leader.  
 
                                  (d). (U) Effects.  The enemy on Company Objective A and Battalion Objective 1 are suppressed allowing the maneuver element to close within direct fire weapons range. 
 
            c. (U) Tasks 
 
      1. (U) 2d Platoon.  You are SE 1. NLT 1500, destroy the enemy IVO Co Obj A in order to prevent them from interfering with the Co ME attack on Bn Obj 1. On signal displace to Bn Obj 1 and link up / consolidate with the rest of the company. BPT suppress the enemy on Bn Obj 1 in order to allow the ME to seize Bn Obj 1. BPT assume the mission of the ME. 
 
      2. (U) 1st Platoon.  You are the ME. Upon effective IDF suppression, seize left ½ of Bn Obj 1 in order to allow the Centralian government to resume communications with the local populace throughout the Quantico Highlands. 
 
      3. (U) 3rd Platoon.  You are SE 2. Upon effective IDF suppression seize right ½ of Bn Obj 1 in order to support the MEs seizure of the comm facility. Detach 1 Fire Team to provide security for the 60mm mortar section, effective immediately. 
 
      4. (U) Weapons Platoon   
 
                          (a) (U) 60mm Mortar Section.  60mm Mortar Section. You are in GS of the company. Establish a firing position in the vicinity of our AA, direction of fire 6400 mils. FIRECAP NLT 1200 and BPT receive fire missions. Priority of fires are to 2nd platoon, 1st platoon, then 3rd platoon. You have one fireteam from 3d Plt for security attached, effective immediately. 
 
    d. (U) Coordinating Instructions 
 
        (1) (U) Timeline   
        0530         Co Commander issues order to Plt Commanders 
0630          Platoons issue orders
1200:         LD 
 
        (2) (U) Formation for Movement.   
 
         1. (U) AA to Atk Pos to LD/PRP.  Company Column – 3d Plt, Co HQ, 1st Plt, 2d Plt. 
 
         2. (U) PRP to Co Obj A.  Determined by 2d Platoon Commander. 
 
         3. (U) PRP to Co Aslt Pos.  Company Column – 3d Plt, Co HQ, 1st Plt, 2d Plt. 
 
      3. (U) Lost Marine Plan.  Each platoon is responsible for developing their own tactically sound Lost Marine Plan. Be prepared to brief me on your plans. 
 
      4. (U) No Comm Plan.  If radio communications are lost at any point between the AA and the PRP, we will immediately halt and spend no more than five minutes in an attempt to regain them. Upon determining the extent of the communications problems, I will make the decision to continue with the operation without communication. Once we have passed the PRP, time is critical due to the independent movement of 2d platoon. Upon departing the Co(-) Aslt Pos, we will continue the operation even if radio communications goes down due to our conditions based, event driven SOM. If unable to radio 60s to commence suppression, we will utilize a white star cluster (WSC) to signal suppression commencement. If that fails, we will utilize SE1 as an SBF to provide suppression for the ME. Once we have assaulted through the objective and consolidated, we will attempt to establish communication using the Communications Facility or via other means (messenger) with BN. 2d Platoon: You are responsible for developing your own No Communication Plan. 


      5. Priority of Rehearsals. Determined by platoon commanders. Each squad will print off and cut out (1) STEX TCM kit and bring appropriate resources (yarn, etc.) to facilitate squad orders delivery.
 
      6. (U) MOPP Level.  Zero. 
 
      7. (U) Rules of Engagement.  Engage only Hostile Forces and Combatants. A Hostile Force is any person that has committed a hostile act, exhibited hostile intent, or has been declared hostile by appropriate U.S. authority. Positive Identification (PID) is required to engage.

      2. (U) CASEVAC.  2d Platoon will develop a CASEVAC plan from the PRP through their consolidation on Co Obj A. Coordinate all CCPs and plan with Co XO and Co 1stSgt for supportability. Establish CASEVAC LZ to the S of Co Obj A for all priority and urgent casualty evacuation upon consolidation on Co Obj A. All main body casualties from LD to the Assault Position will be initially treated by the platoon corpsmen. Platoon Corpsman will determine priority level. Priority and urgent casualties will be coordinated with the Co 1stSgt for immediate evac via air at hasty LZs enroute to the objective. From the Co (-) Assault position to consolidation all casualties will be treated by platoon corpsman and collected according to the platoon’s CASEVAC plan. Upon consolidation, all casualties will be moved to a casualty collection point (CCP) located at 6 o’clock on Bn Obj 1, where the Co Corpsman will treat and triage the casualties. The Co XO and Co 1stSgt will coordinate all casualty evacuations through Battalion TAC 2 according to priority assessed by the company corpsman. Primary evac for all priority casualties will be air. Alternate will be ground. All routine casualties will be evacuated by ground transportation as required.

TIME ZONE: ROMEO


GENERAL SITUATION.  Our recent offensive attacks in the vicinity of DZ Raven and LZ 7 have continued to show significant success in the battalion’s AO.  However, Montanyan regulars have been sighted along Centralia’s northern border (generally along Rt 646 and Rt 619).  This area to date has seen few coalition operations due to the focus of effort in the southern region of thF Country.  It is believed the MRA is going to try to exploit this gap by renewing their infiltration effort in order to continue to reinforce the CRF insurgency.  The battalion is preparing to move north into a new AO IOT stop these border incursions.  Alpha Company has been tasked to begin planning interdiction operations in the new AO prior to the battalion’s arrival IOT gather information about the enemy and terrain in the area, establish a foothold in the AO and develop the situation.


ORIENTATION.  The platoon’s AO is bounded to the south by MCB-1, Route 646 to the north, the 84 Easting to the west and 619 to the east.  The terrain is typical to the Centralian Highland region and is generally not as steep as the southern regions of the country.  The terrain is broken with numerous fingers and draws especially near water features.  This will create numerous cross compartmental danger areas.  There are numerous creeks, with the two main ones being South Fork and Quantico Creek which bisect the AO from NW to SE.  Route 618 bisects our AO from north to south, and there are numerous trail networks throughout the AO creating linear danger areas.  There are eleven LZ’s in the AO however not all have been surveyed and may not be useable for all aircraft types.  There are also areas which have been partially opened by bombing and burned by incendiaries and are restrictive to foot mobile forces.  The vegetation is thick and visibility is normally restricted to 50-100m, sometimes less than 10m in the low areas.  Off road traffic is generally no go for wheeled and tracked vehicles and slow go for foot mobile troops.


I. SITUATION.
        A. Enemy.
                1. Composition, Disposition, and Strength.  Since we have commenced military operations from DZ Raven and LZ 7, enemy forces were observed withdrawing from the Raven/7 AOs and pushing North both directly into the Northern Centralian Highlands and NE around TA16, then re-entering across the Centralia border from the N.  Currently there is a platoon(+) to company (-) size unit of the MRA conducting squad size and smaller operations.  They have been conducting ambushes, to include two within last 24 hours on relief convoys taking supplies to Centralian civilians.  These patrols are armed with a mix of U.S. and Soviet Block small arms and wear woodland pattern utilities and have typically been squad size elements.  They have limited night vision capability and 82mm mortars. Within the last 48 hours EN UAS has been spotted in the area.
                2. Capabilities and Limitations.
                        (a) Defend.  CRF/MRA forces are continuously mobile, and are limited in their ability to defend, unless they mass to plt size strength.  They will attempt to defend their cache sites at all costs.
                        (b) Reinforce.  CRF/MRA forces could reinforce amongst their fellow squads if they are able to establish communications quickly enough.
                        (c) Attack.  CRF/MRA forces could conduct a deliberate attack if they mass to plt size strength.  They are also capable of attacking like size or larger elements by conducting ambushes.
                        (d) Withdraw.  CRF/MRA forces can withdraw from engagements if given a clear avenue of egress and outnumbered.
                        (e) Delay.  CRF/MRA forces can delay our forces from conducting our stabilization and security mission if given the opportunity.
                3. EMLCOA.  Enemy forces have been forced from the DZ Raven and LZ 7 AOs and are now attempting to establish a presence in terrain further North, believing that we will maintain our presence and not pursue them.  Although our enemy has abandoned AOs when it was proven that we could defeat him in a patrol vs patrol fight, he will continue to fight as squad/FT size elements because of his fear of our indirect fire allowing us to mass on his position if he becomes stagnant.  I believe the enemy will position the majority of his forces throughout the TA16 areas, conducting reconnaissance, attempting to establish safe havens, establishing ingress/egress routes, and gathering information and intelligence on the border regions.  Enemy squad size forces will engage like size and smaller forces and if in an advantageous position, will continue to remain engaged until forced off the terrain or they have reason to believe IDF assets are coming to bear upon them.  If in an equal or disadvantaged position, the enemy will withdrawal from their position.
        B. Friendly.

II. MISSION. 1st Plt, SE2, NLT 2200, INTERDICT in TA 16F, TA 16G, and TA 16C, IOT prevent the MRA from infiltrating through TA16 Province and massing combat power.


III. EXECUTION.
        A. Commander’s Intent.
                1. Purpose.  To prevent the MRA from infiltrating through TA16 Province and massing combat power.
                2. Method.  The enemy’s CG is his ability to use covered and concealed routes to infiltrate into and through TA-16.  The enemy’s CV is his inability to quickly reinforce or mass firepower when located.  We will exploit this by conducting a platoon heliborne insert into LZ Peregrine and pushing out squad sized patrols along designated routes throughout our AO.
                3. Endstate.  Enemy prevented from conducting further ambushes of relief convoys or coalition forces in the AO and is unable to mass combat power for an offensive attack into Camp Barrett.  


        B. ConOps.
                1. SOM.  This operation will be conducted in (2) parts.  Part 1 will begin with our heliborne insert into LZ Peregrine and end when each squad has reached its intermediate ORP.  Part 2 will begin with preparation for an ambush patrol at the intermediate ORP and will end with helo extraction from our assigned extraction LZs.
                        (a) Part 1.  Part 1 will begin with our heliborne insert into LZ Peregrine.  Each squad will depart along independent patrol routes to their intermediate ORPs.  Checkpoints will be designated in tasks.  Patrols will report their progress to the platoon commander who will be located at the CoC.  Part 1 will end when each patrol has reached their intermediate LZ, NLT 1500.  
                        (b) Part 2.  Part 2 will begin with ambush patrol preparation at the intermediate ORP.  Each squad will be laid into their ambush site NLT 1845.  Upon completion of the ambush, squads will conduct a night patrol to their extract LZ.  Part 2 will end with helo extraction from extract LZ.  


                        (c)  All squad leaders will pursuant to this order create their own operation order and timeline to support their tasks.  All squads will conduct COC Coordination with the company COC.  


                2. FSP.
                        (a) Task.  Limit the CRF’s ability to affect friendly units with direct fire weapons.
                        (b) Purpose.  IOT allow 1st platoon to move freely throughout the area of operations.
                        (c) Method.  Squads will build their method for their FSP.
                        (d) Effects.  CRF in our area of operations is suppressed.

                9. Rules of Engagement:  Nothing in these ROE will limit your right to take action in SELF-DEFENSE.
                        (a) The CRF and MRF have been declared HOSTILE and MAY BE ATTACKED.  This includes ALL CRF and MONTANYAN military personnel and vehicles TRANSPORTING the ENEMY or ENEMY SUPPLIES.
                        (b) Do NOT attack civilians UNLESS they commit a HOSTILE ACT or it is CLEAR that they are ABOUT TO COMMIT a hostile act (hostile intent) against U.S. Forces.  If a civilian does nothing, they are NOT a threat and may NOT be attacked.
                        
IV. ADMIN AND LOGISTICS.
        A. Administration.
                1. Casualties. Co Corpsman will be located at the company CP, which will be established IVO LZ Peregrine, 18S TH 856 747.  All PLs will generate a CASEVAC plan that takes their casualty to the closest road/trail or LZ.  Any routine casualties that can continue with the mission should do so and be treated upon extract.  Any urgent/priority casualties will be called to the company CP where CASEVAC link-up point will be arranged.  Expect a mobile element, most likely the Bn CAAT to conduct pick-up for priority casualties within 15 minutes of receiving the report.  Expect all urgent casualties to have simultaneous request for Bn CAAT and air CASEVAC.
                2. EPWs. All EPWs taken by patrols will be returned to the company CP for tactical questioning and to be processed to higher echelons.  Detainment authority up to (6) hours lies with any detachment leader (in our case, patrol leaders) and holding longer than (6) hours requires a company commander’s approval.  Ensure that any EPWs/detainees that are taken have actionable evidence that will allow them to be held for further processing.  Treat all with STRESS.
        B. Logistics.  PLs will ensure that all Marines step off w/ four quarts of water and one DOS of chow.
                1. Ammo will be drawn prior to insert.
                2. Radios and extra batteries will be drawn prior to insert.


V. COMMAND AND SIGNAL.
        A. Signal.
                1.  All patrols will utilize company Tac, which will be provided in COC Coordination for all contact with Company.  All CFF missions will be called to Co FiST over Co Tac.

                                                                        FEX I – LZ 7 1st Plt Order


General Situation.  You are the Squad Leaders of 1st Platoon, Fox Company, 2d Battalion 7th Marines.  You are currently in Assembly Area (AA) LZ 7 in the vicinity of (IVO) Camp Barrett, a village located in the province of Centralia. DZ Raven is currently being utilized as a convoy staging area and local distribution center for UN supplies, along with several other sites in the area of operations (AO).  Your battalion recently arrived in this AO and has been briefed that over the last several months the Montanya Regular Army (MRA) has terrorized Camp Barrett through a campaign of intimidation, kidnappings, and murders.  The MRA are not a conventional force such as ours, but they do have a command and control node. The MRA are very proficient fighters but lack the weapon systems and technology we bring to the fight. Recently, the MRA have been predominantly conducting their terror campaign through systematically hijacking UN supplies in order to corrupt and influence the local government. In an effort to stabilize Camp Barrett and Centralia as a whole, our Battalion and specifically our Company has been tasked with securing Camp Barrett and the surrounding areas in order to allow the humanitarian efforts to proceed unimpeded.


Orientation.  Our Area of Operations (AO) is bordered by MCB-3 to the East and North, 84 Easting (parallel to Route 643) to the West, and Aquia Creek to the South.  We are currently located in LZ 7, which serves as our company’s Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) and assembly area, as well as a UN logistics hub. Off-road travel is restricted for vehicles and unrestricted for dismounts.   Surrounding areas are characterized by dense vegetation, numerous draws ranging 20 – 50 meters in depth.  Water frequently occupies the base of the draws after periods of rain, but may not be depicted on our maps. Observation: Visibility ranges from 50-200m during the winter months and 25-100m during summer months. Cover & Concealment: Heavily vegetated areas provide the most concealment for movement, while some low lying areas around Aquia Creek are lightly vegetated and provide enhanced visibility for us and the enemy. Numerous fingers and draws can facilitate cover for movement depending on our direction of travel. Obstacles: Aquia Creek is not normally fordable during the winter months but an adjacent company has reported several positions where foot mobile traffic can cross, although none have been identified in our Company AO as of now. Key Terrain: LZ 7, our assembly area, provides a staging area and distribution center for UN supplies, and therefore is a high priority for MRA forces. Several clearings in surrounding areas are potentially suitable for use as helicopter landing zones for resupply, casualty and EPW evacuation purposes. Avenues of Approach: All unimproved roads are trafficable by both friendly and enemy forces and can also be utilized in conjunction with the MSRs for resupply, casualty and EPW evacuation purposes. Due to lighter vegetation and moderate terrain along water features, dismounted enemy avenues of approach are likely along guiding features such as Aquia Creek.  Potable water sources are available throughout the AO.


1. (U) Situation


    a. (U) Enemy


        (1) (U) Composition/Disposition/Strength.  During the past 24 hours, the MRA have deployed multiple squad (+) sized elements IVO Camp Barrett. Intelligence suggests at least two MRA squad (+) sized units have entered our AO from the South and West of Aquia Creek and the North and West of Road 643. These squads have typically operated in a disaggregated manner, gathering information and familiarizing themselves with the terrain and MSR’s in this area. Recent intelligence indicates that once the MRA have reconnoitered our ASP and logistics hub in LZ 7, they will attempt to conduct harassing attacks on the ASP defenses to determine our disposition and strength, eventually massing to conduct a deliberate attack on our ASP and logistics hub. Total force strength of all the MRA squads in the Company AO appears to be about 30-40 fighters.  The MRA are armed with near peer style small arms including some captured US small arms, M240-Bs, RPGs, and have the ability to coordinate indirect fire. The MRA were last seen wearing desert camouflage uniforms.  Communications are conducted with cellular phones and civilian radios which limits their ability to command and control.


        (2) (U) Capabilities and Limitations.  The MRA is capable of defending their positions but given their small size, they will be unable to defend effectively against squad size elements or larger. MRA is unable to reinforce from outside the AO, while they are capable of limited reinforcement from inside the AO within 45 mins, based on successful communication with adjacent MRA forces in vicinity of LZ 7. The MRA are able to conduct small scale harassing attacks when they can achieve surprise, typically inflicting maximum casualties with light machine guns or small arms before breaking contact and egressing. The MRA is capable of withdrawal, and is likely to withdraw in the direction of MRA forces SW or NE of our AO in order to consolidate their forces as we do not expect them to become decisively engaged.  


        (3) (U) Enemy Most Likely Course of Action.  The enemy’s mission is to reconnoiter our AO and the ASP at LZ 7 in order to enable continued harassment of UN convoys and disruption of the local government. At night, they are conducting ambushes and reconnaissance patrols in our AO, while during the day they alternate between reconnaissance of the AO and defense of their ingress and egress routes. I expect the MRA to defend their ingress routes just outside of our AO with squad (+) size elements. I believe they are at 25% security, moving well-rested fire team (-) elements into our AO during the day in order to provide reconnaissance of friendly force dispositions and early warning to MRA forces. On contact, the enemy fire team (-) elements will defend initially and if not suppressed, attempt to withdraw in the direction of the closest MRA squad position. If they have the element of surprise and advantageous terrain, the enemy will seek to inflict maximum casualties through small-scale ambushes.  I expect the MRA to egress from our AO in the late evening, utilizing the same ingress routes, with new teams infiltrating again in the early morning under the cover of darkness.


    b. (U) Friendly


         (1) (U) Higher’s Mission and Intent.  (SE) On order, Fox Company clears MRA forces from the AO IOT prevent them from interfering with humanitarian efforts and conducting intimidation campaigns IVO Camp Barrett.

    c. (U) Attachments/Detachments.  None


2. (U) Mission.  We are the Main Effort.  NLT 1100 1st Platoon destroys MRA forces IVO platoon objectives IOT prevent them from interfering with humanitarian efforts and conducting intimidation campaigns IVO Camp Barrett.


3. (U) Execution


    a. (U) Commanders Intent.  The purpose of this operation is to prevent the MRA from interfering with humanitarian efforts and conducting intimidation campaigns.  The enemy’s center of gravity is their depth provided by numerous small-sized units conducting harassing attacks and reconnaissance throughout our AO. The enemy’s critical vulnerability is their inability to mass and concentrate their forces due to their lack of mutual support and command and control.  I will exploit this vulnerability by conducting simultaneous squad attacks on isolated MRA units.  My desired endstate is that the MRA is destroyed and unable to conduct operations IVO Camp Barrett, our AO is clear of MRA forces and humanitarian efforts have complete freedom of movement to and from LZ 7.


    b. (U) Concept of Operations


        (1) (U) Scheme of Maneuver.  Our platoon direction of attack is West from LZ 7. We will conduct independent squad attacks throughout the AO on suspected enemy defensive positions during daylight hours.   We will have two supporting efforts (SE) and a main effort (ME).  At 0900, each squad will independently depart our AA at LZ 7. Depending on the objective, squads may be inserted via vehicular assets by our Weapons Platoon. Initial formation of movement will be squad column.  NLT 1100, each squad will have destroyed any MRA forces IVO their objective.  The main effort will destroy MRA IVO Platoon Objective 1 at TH 864 641.  SE 1 will destroy MRA IVO Platoon Objective 2 at TH 865 635.  SE 2 will destroy MRA IVO Platoon Objective 3 IVO TH 863 634. After assaulting through their assigned objective, each squad will consolidate in the direction of the enemy, contact the platoon commander, and be prepared for follow-on operations.  Each squad leader will be responsible for determining their distribution of forces, formations of movement, additional tactical control measures, and form of maneuver to support their attacks.  All squads will return to the Company AA NLT 1900. Mission has priority.


        (2) (U) Fire Support Plan.  


            (a) (U) Task.  Limit the MRA’s ability to affect friendly units with direct fire weapons.


            (b) (U) Purpose.  In order to allow 1st platoon to destroy the MRA without being affected by direct fire weapons.


            (c) (U) Method.  


                1. (U) We will utilize company’s 60mm mortars in support of this attack.  1st Platoon has priority of fires.   1st, 2nd, and 3rd squad are each allocated one priority target during the operation.  Restrictions: None.

                                                                        10 Aug 2020

ASK YOUR SPC FOR YOUR LANE/SECTOR EACH BILLET HOLDER WILL CONDUCT ONE OF THE THREE TOTAL ATTACKS
General Situation.  You are a platoon commander for Company B, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines. You are currently located IVO 794 727 (MOUT Town). Over the past few weeks the Company has been conducting continuous combat operations against the CRF forces in the Centralian Highland Province. During recent diplomatic negotiations, the country of Montanya has agreed to cease providing military support to the CRF, close its borders and stop providing refuge for withdrawing Centralian Forces.  With this loss of support, the Centralians have decided to withdraw and commit the remainder of their conventional forces into key urban areas.  During Operation MOUT FEX, we have destroyed several small elements in the suburbs of MOUT and UTC.  Our squad attacks were initially successful, however the CRF have re-infiltrated the city overnight and are now conducting a strongpoint defense in the larger buildings along the eastern side of town.   


Orientation.  The Company is currently located at an ORP, IVO 7939 7289. Our company AO is MOUT town and approximately the surrounding 5 kilometers in every direction.  Within the AO are LZ Kiwi to the south and MCB-5 to the east, running roughly north to south.  I have divided the city into three sectors: Alpha Sector, composed of buildings A1, A2, A3, and A4; Bravo Sector, composed of buildings B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and C1; Charlie Sector, composed of buildings C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. Boundaries are depicted on the accompanying graphic.  MSR Tampa runs N-S through the city center. Building Composition of all buildings is reinforced concrete. 


1. (U) Situation


    a. (U) Enemy


 (1) (U) Composition, Disposition and Strength. Over the past 24 hours, intelligence collection assets have identified fire team sized units occupying MOUT Town. These units have occupied several buildings and are preparing rudimentary defenses. We believe they are waiting for reinforcements so they can build a mutually supporting, deliberate defense in depth. The CRF are wearing fatigues and carrying both US and Soviet-style small arms. No medium machineguns or rockets have been observed at this time. Their indirect capabilities include possible light mortar systems.  
(2) (U) Capabilities and Limitations (DRAW-D). The fireteam sized elements are capable of defending their positions against a squad (-) sized element by utilizing the cover of buildings and canalizing urban terrain to maximize effects of fires. They are limited by their small size, prohibiting them from defending multiple buildings or a single position against a squad size force or larger. They are capable of reinforcing from within the town to a squad-size. Reinforcing actions from within the town will be limited by the enemies need to maintain a distribution of forces across the town to repel friendly actions. The enemy is capable of conducting harassing attacks and deliberate ambushes at the fireteam level, however they are limited by their inability to mass firepower beyond small arms effects. Any offensive action will be followed with an immediate withdrawal. The enemy is capable of withdrawing to subsequent fireteam fighting positions or falling in with a larger squad sized position. The enemy will be afforded a myriad of building level withdrawal routes to facilitate this. He will be limited in his ability to utilize these egress routes as they are open areas of observation lacking cover from concealment or the effects of fires. Any enemy egressing from the town are likely to do so in an easterly direction utilizing the town to cover their movement into the tree line. The enemy is capable of delaying our advance into the city utilizing forward positions on the edges of the town using observers to call IDF on our advance and disrupt our formations and then engage us with direct fire weapons systems to slow our rate of march before withdrawing to more defendable positions. They are limited in their ability to delay by their wide distribution of small sized forces inability to mass combat power.


(3) (U) EMLCOA. I assess the EN’s mission is to block U.S. troop movement into MOUT Town IOT maintain their control and influence in the town and region. Currently, I believe the EN is establishing a defense in depth centered on the most fortified and defendable position in the city (Co Obj A).  I expect the enemy to have multiple positions established intended to delay our advance, first through the use of observers and IDF then with automatic weapons. Upon friendly forces gaining a foothold, positions of depth will withdraw and consolidate on squad sized positions, ultimately in support of the defense of Co Obj A. With withdrawal routes being cut by adjacent unit containment, I expect him to fight until destroyed in his final position. 




    b. (U) Friendly


         (1) (U) Higher’s Mission and Intent.  Mission: O/O, 2/7 destroys the enemy in Centralian Highland Province IOT deny the CRF units the ability to control the cities.  Method: The enemy Center of Gravity is their interlocking sectors and mutually supported positions.  The enemy’s Critical Vulnerability is the disaggregated nature of their subordinate positions, lacking a significant mass of firepower at any one position.  We will exploit their CV by isolating single positions in order to mitigate their mutual support. We will then mass combat power on each position and systematically seize the town one position at a time.  End state: The CRF forces are eliminated and the civilians are able to move back into their homes and pursue normalcy of living.


        (2) (U) Adjacent


            (a) (U) West.  Company C is currently occupying UTC in preparation for follow on missions.

      (4) (U) Attachments/Detachments.  None


2. (U) Mission.  O/O, Company B destroys the CRF located IVO MOUT town IOT allow civilian populace to return and re-establish normalcy of living.


3. (U) Execution


    a. (U) Commanders Intent.  PURPOSE: Prevent the enemy from reorganizing and massing combat power. METHOD: The enemy Center of Gravity is their ability to mass firepower in the compartmentalized terrain between the buildings. Their Critical Vulnerability is their lack of covered and concealed movement corridors between buildings.  We will exploit this by isolating the enemy squad battle positions and systematically destroying them with platoon attacks from west to east.  ENDSTATE: The enemy in MOUT Town is destroyed. Company G is consolidated on the east side of town. MSR Tampa is still operable for vehicle traffic.


    b. (U) Concept of Operations


        (1) (U) Scheme of Maneuver.  We will have 1 ME and 2 SEs. DOA is East. Company B will conduct simultaneous platoon attacks on enemy positions in MOUT Town. SE 1 will assemble 100m NW of MOUT Town and seize Company Objective A (Bldg A4). The ME will assemble 200m W of MOUT Town and seize Company Objective B (Bldg B3/4).  SE 2 will assemble 200m SW of MOUT Town and seize Company Objective C (Bldg C6/7).  Mortars will establish a mortar firing position IVO 7939 7289.  Upon seizure of all company objectives, all platoons will consolidate on the east side of town, oriented east, and stand by for follow on tasking.

                                                                        PLT D STEX


General Situation.  You are the 2d Platoon Commander, Company D, 2/7.  The battalion has been operating for several weeks in the Bordolo Rio province of the Quantico Highlands.  Company D is currently at Camp Barrett.  The company was tasked with providing physical security for the combat logistics base located at Camp Barrett.  Camp Barrett is currently supporting all Marine forces in the region.  Over the course of the past two weeks the logistics base has been the location of numerous MRA infiltrations.  Intelligence sources have reported that MRA infiltrations may have been aimed at attempting to disrupt logistical support to forward units by destroying the logistics base – specifically its motor transport area, ammunition supply point (ASP) and fuel farm – which prompted the new orders for 2/7.  Delta Company had conducted extensive day and night patrols in order to eliminate MRA infiltrations.  Two days ago, your patrols engaged the MRA, resulting in the death of one U. S. Marine.  Higher has just directed the displacement of the ASP to the field in vicinity of LZ Hawk.  Additionally, he ordered 2/7 to participate in combat operations aimed at destroying several MRA positions recently identified in your assigned AO.  


Orientation.  Company D’s AO is bordered by Chapala Creek to the North, Bordolo Rio Road approximately 1 km to the East (off the sand table), and Hidalgo Road to the South and West.  A prominent gravel road runs throughout the AO into LZ Hawk.  All roads are considered unrestricted for wheeled vehicle traffic.  The vegetation in the Quantico Highlands consists of medium growth hardwood deciduous and evergreen trees with occasional open fields.  The terrain includes rolling hills and fingers with numerous streams and draws.  Thick underbrush and deadfall can be found throughout the region particularly near most streambeds and low areas.  Visibility is limited to 400m in open clearings or marsh areas and reduced to 50m within densely wooded areas.  Off road travel by vehicles is considered severely restricted. All areas are considered unrestricted for foot mobile infantry.  The unimproved roads within the AO are unrestricted for vehicles dependent upon weather.  During heavy precipitation, the unimproved roads may become restricted to severely restricted.  Visibility is dependent upon the season.  Illumination will be 25-30% in hours of darkness.  Weather is as it is today.  


1. (U) Situation


    a. (U) Enemy


        (1) (U) Composition/Disposition/Strength.  During the past 24 hours, the MRA have deployed multiple squads throughout the Bordolo Rio region of the Quantico Highlands located northeast of Camp Barrett.  These units are thought to be attempting to build up their combat power in order to prepare for a possible attack on U.S. forces.  At 0500 this morning, BN scout sniper teams sighted numerous MRA squad patrols within our AO.  They are armed with a U.S. small arms and 60mm mortars, and wear woodland camouflage uniforms. The MRA are known to have limited night vision capabilities.  


        (2) (U) Capabilities and Limitations.  The enemy is capable of defending if they are able to capture LZ Hawk and mass to a platoon size or larger. They are limited by their lack of organization as they are dispersed throughout the AO.  MRA units are capable of reinforcing with up to a platoon size within (45) minutes if they are able to reconnoiter a weak spot in our perimeter defense. They are limited by the distance between their units and thick vegetation in some areas. Due to their current posture, the MRA is capable of conducting hasty attacks on units of like size or smaller, also they are capable of attacking a platoon sized element if they either have surprise or can utilize IDF and maneuver into a position of tactical advantage. They are limited by their desire to avoid decisive contact until they have massed to a platoon size or greater.  The MRA are capable of withdrawing along the multiple avenues of approach and will do so if they become decisively engaged with a platoon sized element or if they suffer 2-3 casualties. They are limited by thick vegetation and steep terrain.  The MRA has the capability to delay the occupation of our defensive position or priorities of work if they are able to identify where we are establishing our defense before we establish depth. They are limited by their inability to coordinate indirect fire at the squad level or lower.


        (3) (U) Enemy Most Likely Course of Action.  I believe that the EN’s mission is to seize the FASP in LZ Hawk IOT stage for a follow-on attack on Camp Barrett. The EN is currently trying to build up combat power in preparation for a Plt(+) attack.  I believe the MRA will use small units to probe and infiltrate our defenses in order to gain intelligence on the disposition of our forces.  On contact, I believe the enemy’s most likely course of action is to use indirect fires and light machine guns to suppress our position and conduct a flanking attack with a platoon.


    b. (U) Friendly


         (1) (U) Higher’s Mission and Intent.  O/O, 2/7 clears the MRA within the battalion’s AO in order to create a stable environment for future elections in the Bordolo Rio Province.  The commander’s desired endstate is that the FASP remains under friendly control, the enemy is unable to conduct an attack on Camp Barrettt, and friendly forces are ready to conduct follow-on missions.


        (2) (U) Adjacent


            (a) (U) West.  None


            (b) (U) South.  Company E (Bn SE1).  NLT 0900, clear S of Hidalgo Rd IOT prevent EN infiltration and exploitation of the Camp Barrett logistics base.  


            (c) (U) North.  At 0600, Bn Scout Snipers reconnoiter and observe MRA forces N of LZ Hawk.  Report any observed MRA activity directly to the Battalion S-2.  Reconnoiter IOT provide D Co with an early warning for enemy infiltration from the north.


            (d) (U) East.  Company F (BN ME).  NLT 0900, clear the MRA forces in the Bordolo Rio region of the Quantico Highlands IOT prevent the massing of MRA combat power within our AO.  


        (3) (U) Supporting.


            (a) (U) Artillery.  Kilo Battery, 3/11 (the FS component of the BLT) is located in a Gun Position (GP) approximately 5km S of LZ Hawk.  DS of the battalion. POF is to F, D, E

2. (U) Mission.  We are SE2.  NLT 1300, protect the FASP @ LZ Hawk IOT prevent EN seizure or destruction of the resources at the FASP.  


3. (U) Execution


    a. (U) Commanders Intent.  The purpose of this operation is to prevent the enemy from seizing or destroying the resources at the FASP.  I believe the enemy’s Center of Gravity is his maneuverability.  I believe his Critical Vulnerability is that after conducting reconnaissance at the squad level, he must mass to effectively capture or destroy the FASP.  I plan to exploit this by defending in sector around LZ Hawk to neutralize enemy forces before they can recon the FASP and mass for an attack.  My endstate is that MRA in our sector are neutralized and rendered incapable of destroying or seizing resources from the FASP, the FASP remains under friendly control, and the Company is prepared for follow on operations.


    b. (U) Concept of Operations


        (1) (U) Scheme of Maneuver.  Our distribution of forces will be one platoon ME, and two platoon SE’s.  We are currently in Camp Barrett.  At 0800, we will conduct a heliborne insert into LZ Hawk.  Company D will establish a company perimeter defense with three platoons in battle positions IVO LZ Hawk.  The orientation of the ME will be northeast.  Immediately upon insert, platoons will recon from the AA to their respective BPs and determine the locations of the engagement areas.  Exact locations of the platoon battle positions will be determined by the platoon commanders during their leader’s reconnaissance.  Platoons will occupy their positions by a technique of the platoon commander’s choosing.  Alternate positions, squad-sized supplementary positions, obstacle plans and early warning indicators should be used to the maximum extent possible to provide flexibility within each platoon BP.  Each platoon must provide at least one LP/OP and patrolling effort focused on the gaps between platoon sectors.  We will initiate patrols NLT 1 hour after occupation.

                                                                        Range 11 Student Order


General Situation.  You are the 2nd Platoon Commander, Company F, 2/7. Our previous operations were a success and prevented the MRA from occupying key terrain in TA-16. Over the last week, our offensive actions have pushed the MRA further east towards Combat Town. The BN is attacking E with one company as the ME, one company as a SE, and one company in reserve in an effort to further degrade the enemy’s ability to reconstitute as a legitimate force in the region.


Orientation.  Company F is located in an AA IVO MOUT Town at TH 794 727. Our company AO boundaries are as follows: MCB-3 to our SW, MCB-6 to our SE, Tokyo Road to our W, Route 645 to our E, and the 74 Northing to our N. Note that the AO is boundary-inclusive. The terrain is Quantico-like with many fingers and draws that vary from 200 to 400 meters in elevation. Vegetation is primarily medium-growth deciduous forest with some coniferous representation. Key terrain within our AO includes several MSRs/ASRs, including Tokyo Road (N-S), MCB 5 (NW-SE), and Dirt-6 (SW-NE). The now friendly-controlled village of MOUT-town lies within our AO and will serve as our company AA. Numerous LZs are within our AO, including LZ Egret (TH 783 725), LZ Cardinal (TH 797 729), LZ Kiwi (TH 795 722), and LZ Buzzard (TH 806 727). Tactical control measures in our AO include the Assembly Area, PRP (TH 795 730), Co Aslt Pos (TH 799 736), BN Obj 1 (TH 825 745), BN Obj 2 (TH 803 736), and Co Obj A (TH 801 726). There are numerous intermittent streams throughout our AO, primarily running N-S in accordance with the draws that open to the northern end of the AO. Extensive trail networks criss-cross our AO; however, most of these trails run IVO of the LZs or parallel to the existing MSRs. The off-road terrain is unrestricted for foot-mobile infantry, but severely restricted for all vehicle traffic. Improved roads are unrestricted for vehicles. The unimproved roads within the AO are unrestricted for vehicles dependent upon weather. During heavy precipitation, the unimproved roads may become restricted to severely restricted. Visibility is dependent upon the season. In summer months, visibility is approximately 250m from the high ground and 25-50m inside of the draws. In winter months, visibility increases to approximately 400-500m from the high ground, and 50m within the draws. Illumination will be 25-30% in hours of darkness. Weather is as it is today.  


1. (U) Situation[a]


    a. (U) Enemy


        (1) (U) Composition/Disposition/Strength.  Within the past ten hours, reconnaissance patrols have confirmed the following EN positions: An MRA Company (-) is currently located IVO BN Obj 1 (TH 825 745), oriented W; an MRA platoon (-), at TH 803 736 (Bn Obj 2) oriented SW; and a MRA sqd (+), is located IVO Co Obj A (TH 801 726), oriented NW with a suspected LP/OP IVO (TH 798 729). All enemy units have US style small arms including M4/M16 rifles, M249 LMG, M240 MMG and were observed preparing defensive fighting positions.  In addition, enemy forces have 81 mm long-range IDF capability.


        (2) (U) Capabilities and Limitations.  The MRA is capable of conducting a deliberate defense utilizing LP/OP’s to effectively give them depth wherever they deem to be key terrain. The enemy is limited by their lack of logistics, which will hinder any long-term defense.  The MRA is capable of reinforcing with up to a Platoon from Montanya within one hour if given the opportunity to utilize the MSR networks but is limited by the ability to conduct effective command and control.  The enemy is capable of conducting small harassing attacks while patrolling from their defensive positions but is limited by their ability to mass firepower.  Due to the effectiveness of our offensive operations, the enemy has a limited ability to conduct a counterattack if pushed from their defensive positions.  The enemy is capable of withdrawing using the MSR network but is limited by the ability to conduct command and control. The MRA is capable of delaying our advance via indirect fires from their LP/OP but is limited by the inability to mass firepower.


        (3) (U) Enemy Most Likely Course of Action.  The MRA Company(-) mission is to block north of MCB 6 IOT retain control of the MSR network.  The current positions reflect the MRA’s last holds in the TAOR. Holding the MSR network is critical to their ability to divert our forces and to delegitimize the Centralian government. The MRA has broken into their usual T/O in order to achieve some depth in their defense reflecting the importance they place on controlling the MSRs.  The enemy is currently fortifying their defensive positions and are likely at 25% security as they dig.  On contact, the enemy has an LP/OP that will serve as advance warning and alert the enemy to our actions. That LP/OP will use 81 mm mortars in order to call long range fires onto our formations and attempt to get us to culminate early or canalize us into their engagement area.  The enemy will then engage us with direct fire, starting with machineguns and then all other small arms, as we progress into their engagement area.  The enemy will withdraw after sustaining 25% casualties but will attempt to reorganize and mount a counterattack.        


    b. (U) Friendly


        (1) (U) Higher’s Mission and Intent.  O/O, 2/7 destroys the EN MRA units IVO BN Objectives 1 and 2, and Co Obj A IOT deny the EN the use of the MSR network within the AO. The BN CO’s endstate: The EN in the AO destroyed or forced to withdraw, the MSRs open to friendly traffic, and friendly forces consolidated at key intersections IOT deny the EN’s use of the MSR network to resupply EN forces.


        (2) (U) Adjacent


            (a) (U) West.  Company E (rein) (BN ME) is to the West. O/O Company E destroys EN MRA Co (-) on BN Obj 1 IOT deny EN the ability to resupply dispersed forces.


            (b) (U) South.  No friendly units are to the South.


            (c) (U) North.  The BN COC (Rear), Weapons Company, Company G (BN Res), and the BN logistics trains are to the North.


            (d) (U) East.  Delta Co LAR is currently conducting screening operations IOT protect our right flank along MCB 6 from LZ Turkey to the MCB 6E Gate to the South.


        (3) (U) Supporting.


            (a) (U) Bn 81mm Mortars. BN 81mm mortar section is in GS of Companies F, E, and G. The mortar section is located IVO LZ Hummingbird (790        747). 




    c. (U) Attachments/Detachments.  None.


2. (U) Mission.  O/O, Company F destroys enemy units IVO Bn Obj 2 and Co Obj A IOT prevent the enemy from using the MSR network within the AO.


3. (U) Execution


    a. (U) Commanders Intent.  


        (1) (U) Purpose. The purpose of this operation is to prevent the enemy from using the MSR network within the AO.


        (2) (U) Method. The enemy’s center of gravity is their prepared defensive positions. The enemy’s critical vulnerability is their fixed orientation. The Company will exploit this critical vulnerability by conducting a rapid assault utilizing combined arms.


        (3) (U) Endstate. My desired endstate is that the EN MRA forces are destroyed, the MSR network within our AO is under friendly control, and friendly forces are consolidated and prepared for follow on operations.


    b. (U) Concept of Operations


        (1) (U) Scheme of Maneuver.  Co F will conduct two independent and near-simultaneous attacks on Co Obj A and BN Obj 2. The distribution of forces is one platoon as the ME, one platoon as SE1, and one platoon as SE2. The direction of attack will be southeast. The ME will depart the AA and move to the Atk Pos in a company column, platoon column. O/O, the company will cross the LD and move to the PRP. At the PRP (TH 795 730), SE2 will be released. O/O, SE 2 will destroy the EN MRA sqd (+) on Co Obj A. The Co (-) will move from the PRP to the Co Aslt Pos (TH 799 736) in a company column (ME in front and SE1 in trace). Upon occupying the Co Aslt Pos, we will transition to a company (-) online oriented E with the ME on the right 1/2 and SE1 on the left 1/2. I will call for six minutes of suppression: 3min HE/Q from the BN 81mm mortars. As the fires lift, (O/O), the Co (-) will conduct a frontal attack, assaulting from W to E through BN Obj 2. We will consolidate oriented E, with the ME responsible for the right 1/2 of the objective and SE1 responsible for the left 1/2 of the objective. After destroying the EN MRA on Co Obj A, SE2 will consolidate oriented SE and await the signal to displace to the Company (-) on BN Obj 2.


        (2) (U) Fire Support Plan.  


            (a) (U) Task.  [b] suppress the EN Plt (-) on BN Obj 2 and the EN Sqd (+) on Co Obj A


            (b) (U) Purpose.  IOT allow the company (-) to close within direct fire weapons range.


            (c) (U) Method.  


                1. (U) I have planned two targets, AA 2201 and AA 2202 which are located on BN Obj 2 and CO Obj A respectively. I will be the primary observer for AA 2201 (Bn Obj 2) and 2d platoon will be responsible to observe for AA 2202 (Co Obj A). For AA 2201, I will request F 2/11 to engage with three minutes of suppression, shell HE/fuze Quick. For AA 2202, 2d Platoon will have 3 minutes of suppression from 81 mm mortars, shell HE/fuze Quick.


            (d). (U) Effects.  The EN is effective suppressed on Co Obj A and Bn Obj 2 allowing maneuver elements to close on the EN.


    c. (U) Tasks


        (1) (U) 1st Platoon.  You are the Company ME. O/O, destroy the right 1/2 of the EN plt (-) IVO BN Obj 2 IOT deny the EN control and effective use of the MSR network within the AO. You have two MMG squads, 2 60 mm mortar squads and four Aslt Teams attached, effective immediately.


        (2) (U) 2nd Platoon. You are the Company SE2. O/O, destroy the EN sqd (+) IVO Co Obj A IOT prevent the EN sqd (+) from interfering in the Co ME atk on BN Obj 2.  You have 1 60 mm mortar squad attached and 1 MMG squad in DS of the platoon, effective immediately. EST SBF Pos IVO (TH 797 729) w/MMG Squad to set conditions for the start of the CO (-) attack. Plan 2 targets (3 min of 81mm suppression) in support of your attack. 


        (3) (U) 3rd Platoon. You are the Company SE1. O/O, destroy the left 1/2 of the EN plt (-) IVO BN Obj 2 IOT deny the EN control and effective use of the MSR network within the AO. You have two Aslt Teams attached, effective immediately. 


        (4) (U) Weapons Platoon.  Detach two Aslt Teams, 2 MMG squads, and 2 60 mm mortar squads to 1st Platoon, effective immediately. Detach 1 MMG squad to 2nd Platoon, they will be in GS effective immediately.  Detach 2 Aslt Teams to 3rd Platoon, effective immediately.


        (5) (U) 60mm Mortar Section.  Attach 2 mortar squads to 1st platoon to be used in their attack and attach 1 mortar squad to 2d platoon to be used in their respective attacks, effective immediately.

        (4) (U) Lost Marine Plan. 


            (a) (U) AA to Aslt Pos. If a Marine becomes lost between the AA and the Aslt Pos, the lost Marine will orient themselves to the terrain and head west, using the location of the sun as a primary guiding feature and the contours of the terrain (decrease in elevation) as an alternate guiding feature. Once the Marine has eyes on MCB 5, he will turn left and move along the road (in the tree line) until he arrives at the AA location. He will execute the near/far recognition signal.


            (b) (U) Aslt Pos to Obj. If a Marine becomes lost between the Aslt Pos and the Obj, the lost Marine will return to the Aslt Pos and remain there for two hours. Once two hours have passed, the Marine will orient themselves to the terrain and head west, using the location of the sun as a primary guiding feature and the contours of the terrain (decrease in elevation) along the W-E trail as an alternate guiding feature. Once the Marine has eyes on MCB 5, he will move along the road (in the tree line) until he arrives at the AA location. He will execute the near/far recognition signal as per company SOP


            (c) (U) 2d Platoon, develop a LMP for your SOM.


        (5) (U) No Comm Plan.  If communications are lost at any point in the operation, we will immediately attempt to regain them. If we cannot reestablish communications, we will continue the operation and replace any indirect fires with a hasty SBF position. Once we have assaulted through the objective and consolidated, we will attempt to establish communication via other means (messenger) with BN.


        (6) (U) Weapons Test Fire.  Platoons are authorized to conduct a test fire of all MGs prior to crossing the LD. However, these test-fires        need to be requested through the Company Commander.

 ﻿Platoon Urban Patrolling Order 


General Situation: You are Platoon Commander, 3rd Platoon, Golf Co, Battalion Landing Team 2/7. Over the past few weeks the Company has been conducting continuous combat operations against the CRF and MRA forces in the Centralian Highland Province. During recent diplomatic negotiations, the country of Montanya has agreed to cease providing military support to the CRF, close its borders and stop providing refuge for withdrawing Centralian Forces.  With this loss of support, the Centralians have decided to withdraw and commit the remainder of their conventional forces into key urban areas.  During Operation MOUT FEX, we have destroyed several small and medium sized elements IVO MOUT Town and UTC.  In response to our series of squad and platoon attacks the CRF have been driven from city and resorted to irregular operations utilizing snipers, IEDs, and complex ambushes as a means to disrupt our operations and destabilize the local populace as they return to MOUT and UTC.  


Orientation:  The Company is currently located at UTC FOB. The Company sector is UTC bordered by Tokyo Rd to the West, MCB-5 to the East, MCB-8 to the North, and LZ Kiwi to the South. MSR Tampa is the MSR that runs N-S through MOUT Town. 


Civilian Considerations: Currently we have a limited understanding of the residual civilian populace within UTC as the populace returns to the town. What we know right now is that there is a civilian population of around 50-75 personnel in the town. The language is Spanish, with predominantly the religion being 70% Muslim, with around 30% Christian. The population tends to be significantly male heavy, at about 80%, with the women largely being regarded as homemakers, predominantly focused on child-rearing near the homes. The largest industry is farming in this AO, with the predominance of farmland growing poppy to the north of UTC. There is no known infrastructure such as plumbing and electricity in the town. UTC is predominantly divided into three districts, UTC A, B and C. The C sector is the central area of civilian population with a central marketplace IVO C35 and C36. General pattern of life are personnel conducting bartering and trading in that area during the periods of daylight. There is one known culturally sensitive area in this sector, being the Mosque at C58. Residents largely live within the C sector. In the B sector, population is sparse. There are heat signatures that appear to be residential in the NE corner of this sector, as well as some along the main E-W running MSR on the S side of the sector. In the A sector, there are very limited amounts of civilian personnel. We have identified limited heat signatures of what appears to be military age males that live and work around buildings A21-22 and A24, this group tends to rarely leave this portion of the town or move towards the farmland. These personnel have been seen moving at times to buildings within the C sector, but largely only one or two at a time. The only known governmental infrastructure in the UTC is the Police Chief, who works IVO C07. HUMINT has made contact with this individual via WhatsApp and he is our only known contact on the deck. Our assessment is that he is looking to re-establish the way of life in UTC, but has limited security forces in the AO. We assess that he will be our best POC to establish a long term security relationship with the populace here. The only significant breach from pattern of life has was last week when there appeared to be an explosion IVO A39. Based on civilian chatter picked up via cell phone comms, there was talk of a little girl being injured due to some fertilizer that caught fire near that building, permanently maiming the girl. Pattern of life since then has largely returned to normal, but market place operations were largely suspended for the three days following the blast. 




I. Situation


A. Enemy:  


COMPOSITION, DISPOSITION, AND STRENGTH – An enemy squad sized element is believed to have infiltrated the local populace of UTC and are planning to conduct harassing attacks against US forces. Four hours ago enemy forces were observed emplacing IEDs IVO UTC. They are armed with Soviet style small arms, to include Machine Guns, and IEDs.




CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS – 
The enemy will not initiate sustained contact with US Forces. The enemy is using guerilla tactics to inflict casualties on security patrols in order to destabilize the town of UTC. The enemy will use IEDs to initiate ambushes and cover the withdraw of their forces. Once the enemy has gained control of the local populace and limited the effects of the security patrols of US forces they will mass to a platoon sized element and conduct a deliberate attack on UTC FOB IOT regain control of the area. 


EMLCOA:  I believe the enemy is currently identifying choke points and emplacing IEDs to interdict friendly patrols. If afforded the freedom of movement among local populace they will seek to destabilize security operations and hinder civic rebuilding actions. They will initiate contact with sniper fire, IEDs, and complex ambushes before immediately withdrawing to increase survivability. Upon gaining control of urban centers the enemy will mass to a platoon sized element and conduct a deliberate attack on UTC FOB IOT regain control of the region and reestablish legitimacy.

A. Cmdr’s Intent 


Purpose:  Establish a secure local environment for the indigenous population so they can pursue their economic, social, cultural, and political well-being and conduct civic reconstruction IOT achieve local governance achieve some degree of local normalcy. 


Method: 
CG – the ability to blend into the local populace gives the enemy the freedom of movement to emplace IEDs and initiate harassing attacks on US forces.


CV – the enemy’s small size prevents them from massing and sustaining contact with friendly forces.


Exp – We will exploit the enemy CV by providing a continuous security presence to the area that disrupts the enemy’s ability to emplace IEDs and conduct attacks. 




End state: The irregular CRF forces are eliminated and the civilians are able to pursue normalcy of living. Remaining CRF forces are eliminated and civic reconstruction efforts continue unopposed. 


B. Concept of Operations:

(U) REFERENCES: 13TH MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT OPERATION ORDER 002-20


(U) TIME ZONE: Zulu 


(U) TASK ORGANIZATION. Annex A.


1. Situation


   1. General.  We are currently located at the company assembly area (LZ Turkey 789 715). Over the past few months the Company has been conducting continuous combat operations against the CRF forces in the country of Centralia. During recent diplomatic negotiations, the country of Montanya has agreed to cease providing military support to the CRF and close its borders and stop providing refuge for withdrawing Centralian Forces. With this loss of support, the Centralians have decided to withdraw and commit the remainder of their conventional forces into key urban areas in an attempt to gain popular support and maintain their control and influence in the region. Our most recent intelligence indicates the CRF are infiltrating the capital city of Hogan in buddy pair or fire team sized elements in order to disrupt political stability in Centralia. During Phase I of Operation MOUT FEX, we destroyed many of these smaller elements in their safe houses through the use of widely distributed squad size attacks.  However, with the support of the local populace the total strength of the CRF insurgency has continued to grow in the city center of MOUT Town. We will now begin PHASE II of Operation MOUT FEX, where we will maneuver with platoon size elements against the entrenched CRF in the city center of MOUT Town.


   2. Battlespace.


      1. Area of Interest.  OMMITED


      2. Area of Operations.  Our company sector is a small suburb of Combat Town, called MOUT Town, IVO 18S TH 794 727 (Bn Obj 1) and is bordered by LZ Kiwi to the south and MCB 5 to the northeast. The suburb has an estimated population of 1,000 people, but most of the civilians fled when the CRF moved in by force. Several of the buildings around the edges of the suburb have been reduced to rubble. To the north is the core periphery and city center of MOUT Town. Access to the city center through our company sector can only be achieved by transiting along MSR Tampa, which runs through our company sector from north to southwest. A platoon boundary between 3rd (West) and 2nd platoon (East) also runs along MSR Tampa. Phase Line (PL) Apple is the company LOA. Lastly, there is a working sewer system that HUMINT has confirmed runs between some of the buildings in the town.


   3. Enemy Forces


      3. Composition, Disposition, Strength.  Intelligence collection assets have identified approximately a platoon reinforced CRF element IVO the northern portion of our company sector 18S TH 794 727. Intelligence and satellite imagery suggests CRF insurgents have moved into the area and have begun to fortify defensive positions along MSR Tampa which appear to be blocking south. We suspect they are blocking for the left (east) flank of a CRF company (-) sized force located north of our sector. Any follow on attack on this company of CRF will have to transit our sector first.  The CRF are wearing desert fatigues and carrying small caliber weapons like M4’s and M16’s. Their automatic weapons capabilities are most likely limited to M240’s and M249’s. Indirect capabilities include 60 and 81mm mortars and limited 155mm artillery. 


      4. Capabilities and Limitations.  The platoon in our AO has the ability to defend from their established positions until those positions become untenable due to overwhelming fires or taking casualties.  They retain the ability to be reinforced; however, it is estimated that it will take at least one hour based on the proximity of CRF company (-) and the coordination required.  They have the ability to attack our forces within roughly 1km of MOUT Town.  They have demonstrated the ability to use anything from a FT to a full platoon to conduct attacks against our forces.  They also have the ability to attack by fire as we close on the town and enter their developed engagement areas.  Intelligence and satellite imagery both point to this element being part of a larger company (-) sized CRF element, as such they will have a planned withdrawal route that will be covered by their IDF assets and allow them to link up with the bulk of their force as they withdraw to the east.  The enemy in MOUT Town also has the ability to delay us prior to and after our clearance of MOUT Town with the IDF assets and their developed engagement areas.  They also have the ability to delay as wen clear through the town as they can bound back ahead of our lead elements to delay us in every building that we encounter in MOUT Town.  


      5. Enemy’s Most Likely Course of Action. The CRF mission is to defeat coalition forces in Centralia. Currently the CRF platoon is fortifying their defensive positions and trying to gain depth in their defense with patrols and LP/OP’s.  On contact the CRF platoon will attempt to delay our advance in three parts.  Prior to our entrance into MOUT Town they will use patrols to locate us and conduct harassing attacks and attempt to call for fire on our positions.  Once we are inside the city they will bound back through their positions forcing us to fight through each building in the city which will slow our advance.  Lastly as we close on the last buildings in MOUT Town they will again use direct and indirect fires to cover their withdrawal to the north once their positions become untenable.


   4. Friendly Forces


      6. Higher Mission. O/O, 2/7 destroys the enemy IVO MOUT Town IOT deny the CRF units the ability to control the city.  


      7. Higher Commander’s Intent


         1. Purpose. Support 13th MEU efforts to protect the country of Centralia from CRF aggression and to deny the dissident force's ability to conduct offensive operations in MOUT Town.


         2. Method.  The enemy Center of Gravity is their interlocking sectors and mutually supported positions.  The enemy’s Critical Vulnerability is the disaggregated nature of their subordinate positions, lacking a significant mass of firepower at any one position.  We will exploit their CV by isolating single positions in order to mitigate their mutual support. We will then mass combat power on each position and systematically seize the town one position at a time.  


         3. End State.  The enemy threat and ability to affect the political affairs of MOUT Town is eliminated and US forces are positioned to repel CRF attacks from the north attempting to retake the city, and infrastructure is retained intact as able to allow for ease of transfer back to the local government.


      8. Adjacent. 


         4. Company G(+).  ME. Conduct a forward passage of lines through Company E’s sector MOUT Town and destroys the CRF Company (-)(+) IVO of MOUT Town IOT prevent the CRF from interfering in the political affairs of MOUT Town. SE2 


         5. Company F.  Battalion reserve.  


         6. Weapons Co (-).  Screen to the east of Company E during its assault north. Upon clearance of Combat Town, Weapons Co (-) screens to the east of G and F Companies IOT prevent CRF reinforcements from interfering w/ the ME attack on the city center of MOUT Town.         
      9. Supporting: 81mm Mortar Platoon located IVO LZ Goshawk 18S TH 783 740 is in GS of the Battalion POF G, E, W (-), F.  (1) Engineer Section with mechanical breaching capabilities and SMAWs. 


   5. Civilian Populace.  UAS and satellite imagery identifies approximately 17 buildings making up this town with only one other town near-by, 1500m West.  The population MOUT Town are comparatively low with an estimation that only half the buildings are actually occupied, in part due to the insurgency. A majority of the civilians have left in the wake of the increasing CRF presence. This area has never interacted with uniformed U.S forces before and our presence could come as a shock or be received with curiosity.  Either way, we know the majority of the population is inclined to side with U.S. interests.  Most are not happy about the insurgent activity.  Local intelligence assets have confirmed at least one cell of enemy sympathizers, backed by the CRF, residing within the town.  Best estimates put the number of enemies at a squad minus.  These sympathizers are known to utilize IEDs and Sniper fire. The predominant language is Spanish with few being able to speak English. The people tend to be passionate, regardless of whether their attitude is friendly or hostile. If the men feel slighted, they will become uncooperative to the point of defiance, regardless of whether they are armed or not. The women are culturally hospitable and welcoming, but this typically has no correlation to romantic interest. The education level is not particularly high. Predominant religion is Christianity. There is an established local authority, however their influence is not seen as particularly effective.  


5. Attachments and Detachments.  (1) Engineer Section with mechanical breaching capabilities and SMAWs to prep entry to buildings. 


2. Mission.  NLT 1300, Co E destroys the CRF platoon located at BN Obj 1 (Combat Town) IOT allow G and F Companies to conduct forward passage of lines into MOUT Town and destroy the CRF Company (-) located there. BPT isolate to the north and east IOT prevent CRF reinforcements from interfering w/ the ME attack on MOUT Town’s city center. 


3. Execution


   6. Commander’s Intent  


      10. Purpose.  To allow G and F Companies to conduct forward passage of lines into MOUT Town and destroy the CRF Company (-)(+) located there. 


      11. Method.  The enemy's COG is their prepared defensive positions, specifically the engagement areas S and W along MSR Tampa. Their CV is their inability to be rapidly reinforced. I intend to exploit this by rapidly conducting sequential platoon attacks. We will first seize the buildings to the E of MSR Tampa to eliminate the western engagement area.  We will then seize all buildings to the W of MSR Tampa IOT seize all of MOUT Town.  


      12. End State.  Destruction of the CRF platoon and their ability to interfere with the ME attack on Combat  Town while still preserving the local infrastructure for follow on operations and handover back to the civilian populace. 


   7. Concept of Operations 


      13. Scheme of Maneuver.  DOA is north. The company will conduct a frontal attack with one Plt (+) as Security Unit, one Plt (+) as the Support Unit, and one Plt (+) as the Assault Unit. This will be a three-stage operation. All Units BPT TO ROTATE and fill the roles of Security, Support, and Assault. 


         7. Stage A: Seizure of Co Obj A.

         8. Stage B: Seizure of Co Obj B.  
-Begins with: Security Unit isolating Co Obj B from Co Obj A which sets conditions for the Assault Unit to Seize Co Obj B. 
-Ends With: Seizure of Co Obj B, Assault will immediately transition to Security to providing isolation on Co Obj B.   
-Critical Events: Assault Unit Clears from Phase Line Banana to Phase Line Apple. 
                             Assault Unit Seizes Co Obj B 
                             Support Unit Follows in Support 
-Conditions Set: Isolate Co Obj C IOT allow Stage C Assault to Seize Co Obj C. 


         9. Stage C: Seizure of Co Obj C. 
-Begins with: Security Unit isolating Co Obj C, which sets conditions for the Assault Unit to Seize Co Obj C.  
- Ends with: Co Obj C Seized by the Assault Unit, all units will transition to security in order to allow for Bn Forward Passage of Line.  
-Critical Events: 
                             Assault Unit Clears from Phase Line Banana to Co Obj C
                             Assault Unit Seizes Company Obj C
                             Assault, Support, and Security Consolidate N Side of MOUT Town in 360 defensive

A Series A Group


General Situation.  You are the # Platoon Commander, Echo Company, 2nd Battalion 7th Marines.  You are currently aboard the USS Bataan serving as the helicopter company of Battalion Landing Team (BLT) for 2nd Battalion 7th Marines.  Co F 2/7 and BLT 2/7 are currently located on separate ships in our Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG), all located off the southwest Coast of Upshur Island.  The MRA has recently sent an additional Company (+) to Upshur Island after our recent successes there.  Their endstate is to reinforce, reorganize, and conduct offensive operations on Quantico Island.
BLT 2/7 has been tasked with clearing the enemy on the Upshur Island IOT prevent the enemy from seizing Port Upshur and regaining control of the Centralian Islands.  The MEB commander intends to clear the island utilizing BLT 2/7 to conduct distributed patrolling and offensive operations. To set conditions for the BLT operations, he intends to utilize the helicopter company, Co K, in order to gain a foothold and establish initial security on the island and facilitate a strong logistical route from Port Upshur.


Orientation.  We are currently on board the USS Bataan just off of the Southwest coast of Upshur Island.  The AO boundaries are as follows:
-      North- MCB 8
-      East- Hangman Tree Rd
-      South- 74N
-      West- Rte 645
Terrain/Vegetation: Terrain consists of rolling hills, and intermittent streams in low lying areas. There is mostly thin vegetation in pockets of the region, but is vastly covered with dense vegetation.  During the summer months, vegetation significantly reduces visibility from 200 – 300 meters on high ground to100 – 200 meters in low ground and around streams. During the winter, observation can reach 400 – 500 meters in high ground, due to the lack of foliage.  Hills vary in elevation up to 30 meters, which can canalize and result in slow movement. The AO has many streams and creeks, all of which are fordable on foot, but will slow movement significantly. Weather is similar to our previous operations in the area.


Major Roads:  There are several major roads in the AO: MCB 1, 5, 6, 8, RTE 609, RTE 618, RTE 645, RTE 646, and Hangman Tree Rd.  These roads are considered to be unrestricted to vehicular traffic. The MRA does not currently utilize these roads as a result of our shaping fires; which had devastating effects against MRA convoys. The trafficability of the trails on the map are unknown at this time.


The following LZ’s are capable to support air CASEVAC’s and air resupply (All other LZ’s are considered unsupportable for air CASEVAC and air resupply):
-      LZ Eagle (TH 829791)
-      LZ Pheasant (TH 821779)
-      LZ Vulture (TH 829779)
-      LZ Drake (TH 805766)
-      LZ Tern (TH 810759)
-      LZ Crane (TH 828754)
-      LZ Duck (TH 823745)
-      LZ Canary (TH 845769)
-      LZ Fazica (TH 861758)
-      LZ Snipe (TH 829764) 


The MEB is located at Camp Barrett on Quantico Island (TH 870740). The BLT 2/7 CP Forward is located on USS Mesa Verde off the Northern Coast of Upshur Island. The company forward command post is currently located on the USS Bataan. The company will establish its command post at Port Upshur as we echelon forces ashore.






1. (U) Situation


    a. (U) Enemy


        (1) (U) Composition/Disposition/Strength.  Throughout the last 48 hours the MRA have been reinforced at Upshur Island.   S-2 assessments indicate the MRA will reinforce to a Company (+) size. The MRA are known to wear camouflage uniforms and protective armor.  They typically wear US style utilities in both woodland and desert varieties.  Often, they do not match their pattern to the season/foliage.  The MRA forces are currently re-consolidating to conduct offensive operations to regain a foothold after their recent defeats by coalition forces on the island. The MRA are located within RTE 645, MCB 1, MCB 8, and Hangman Tree Rd at, establishing defensive positions in preparation for reinforcements to arrive on island. They are carrying US style small arms to include M4/M16 rifles, M240 medium machine guns, and possess night vision capabilities. Additionally, they have 81mm mortar assets, but their locations are unknown at this time. They have complex communication capabilities, allowing them communication across their entire AO, and the ability to coordinate with their 81mm mortars. They are known to have basic proficiency with their mortars and can usually achieve effects on target with minimal adjustments. The enemy has not been seen using hardball roads and identifiable trails due to superiority of our close air support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets.  Instead, friendly patrols and human intelligence reporting indicates the enemy primarily uses natural avenues of approach such as streams, draws, and game trails.


        (2) (U) Capabilities and Limitations.  
            (a) (U) Defend: The MRA are capable of defending via their established platoon battle positions. They are capable of defending their positions through forward patrols and LP/OPs coordinating with the main battle position in order to call for indirect fire or prepare for deliberate employment of fires within their established engagement areas.  They are limited in their ability to defend as a result of their limited intelligence assets as they are known to only use UAS systems sparingly and patrolling elements from their defensive battle position.
            (b) (U) Reinforce: The enemy is capable of reinforcing from a platoon to Company (-) within 1.5 hours due to the large number of enemy forces within the AO.  However, they have to gain significant information regarding our composition, disposition, and strength before they will do so.  They are limited in their ability to reinforce due to their lack of reconnaissance assets, delaying their ability to provide timely information required for an effective reinforcement. 
            (c) (U) Attack: The enemy is capable of conducting a complex attack by overlapping indirect and direct fires against a gap in our defense.  They typically employ support by fire positions to provide longer duration direct fire suppression which allows their maneuver element to close with our forces.  They are limited in their ability to attack by terrain and visibility.  They struggle to find effective assault positions and support by fire positions with enough visibility to provide desired effects.
            (d) (U) Withdraw: The enemy is capable of withdrawing along high speed avenues of approach.  However, once committed to the attack, the enemy is extremely limited in their ability to conduct a deliberate withdraw action. 
            (e) (U) Delay: The main enemy force is extremely limited in their ability to delay our actions.  However, squad size or smaller patrols are capable of delaying our occupation of battle positions in order to further mass troops and conduct a complex attack.
        (3) (U) Enemy Most Likely Course of Action. The enemy company’s mission is to seize LZ Duck, LZ Crane and LZ Snipe IOT utilize them as logistical resupply hubs, retransmission sites and prepare for follow on offensive operations at Quantico Island. Currently the enemy has established platoon sized battle positions away from MSRs.  Once they become aware of our insert, they will conduct squad sized patrols in an attempt to determine our disposition and identify TCMs. Upon our insert, I believe their mission will be to initially disrupt our occupation of our battle positions in order to set conditions to seize LZ Drake, LZ Pheasant and LZ Vulture and prevent us developing freedom of movement throughout the AO. I believe they have (3) various Plt (+) sized forces each equipped with at least (1) LMG and MMG squad.  I believe the patrols will attempt to gain intelligence on our positions in preparation for platoon sized attacks.  If the enemy identifies a unit in the process of occupying, they will conduct limited attacks to disrupt our forces to allow them time to reinforce to a platoon sized element and conduct a deliberate combined arms attack.  I expect them to initiate their assaults on our battle positions simultaneously across the AO.  They will begin each assault with indirect fires to allow their machineguns to occupy a support by fire position within 200m of our battle positions.  Once the SBF position has effects on our battle position, their maneuver element will assault one of our flanks, attempting to avoid our main engagement area.  Once the support fires have begun, they will not cease the attack despite taking significant casualties.  If we successfully destroy one or more platoons, the rest of the company will withdraw southwest out of the AO away from Port Upshur.


    b. (U) Friendly


1. (U) Higher’s Mission and Intent.  


1. Mission: At 2200 on D-Day + 4, destroy the enemy IVO Upshur Island IOT keep Port Upshur open to facilitate logistical resupply.


2. Commander’s Intent: Endstate: Friendly forces control Upshur Island, the MRA are destroyed and unable to reinforce.


        (2) (U) Adjacent


            (a) (U) Fox Co: ME At 2200, D Day +3, Fox Co destroys enemy IVO BN OBJ 1 (TH 786 759) IOT deny the En the ability to reinforce at Camp Upshur.
            (b) (U) Golf Co: SE 2: At 2200, D-Day +3, Golf Co destroys enemy IVO TH 797 754, IOT allow BLT to establish CP.


        (3) (U) Supporting. 1 squad of engineers attached, effective immediately, until further direction.  1 MMG Squad from Weapons platoon is attached to each platoon effectively immediately.  


            (a) (U) Bn 81mm Mortars. Wpns Co, 81mm Mortar Platoon is in DS of Company E and will land IVO LZ Redwing.  POF are to ME, SE1, SE2, SE3.


            (b) (U) CAAT 1. CAAT 1 is in DS of Company E and will land IVO DZ Redwing.
    c. (U) Attachments/Detachments. 1 squad of engineers attached, effective immediately, until further direction.  1 MMG Squad from Weapons platoon is attached to each platoon effectively immediately.  


2. (U) Mission.  We are SE 3.  At 1100 on D-Day, Company E, 2/7 block in sector South of MCB - 8 IOT prevent MRA forces from seizing LZs Drake, Pheasant, and Vulture and moving north towards the Battalion Forward established IVO Port Upshur.  


3. (U) Execution


    a. (U) Commanders Intent.  


        (1) (U) Purpose. The purpose of this operation is to prevent the enemy from seizing Port Upshur, the BLT’s forward staging area.
        (2) (U) Method. I believe the enemy’s center of gravity is their ability to conduct a combined arms attack with machineguns and indirect fire. Their critical vulnerability is their lack of freedom of movement throughout the AO caused by our air superiority, effective CAS, DAS and UAS.  This forces them to avoid using roads/trails and instead handrail these avenues of approach, resulting in a significant amount of time to mass for a coordinated attack. We will exploit his critical vulnerability by establishing a company level defense in depth that will block their use of key avenues of approach. We will disrupt their ability to seize Port Upshur by forcing them into our platoon engagement areas and destroy them with direct fire and indirect fire.


        (3) (U) Endstate. Enemy combat power reduced in our AO, Port Upshur remains in friendly control, and friendly logistical supply routes remain open.


    b. (U) Concept of Operations


        (1) (U) Scheme of Maneuver.  We will establish a company linear defense utilizing three platoon battle position defenses with (1) ME and (2) SEs. I will array the three battle positions to block the enemy and prevent their seizure of LZ Drake, LZ Pheasant and LZ Vulture.  Platoon commanders have the latitude to orient their positions locally to develop the best possible engagement area along viable avenues of approach.  Based on your leader’s reconnaissance, provide a recommendation for the specific site of your position within the sector provide to you by the company.  Ensure your direct and indirect fires will not impact adjacent platoons.  Platoon commanders will determine occupation methods, security plans, alert status, patrol routes, LP/OP locations, and priorities of work as you see fit.  The company will conduct a helicopter borne insert to LZ Drake, LZ Pheasant and LZ Vulture.  Order of movement will be SE1, ME, and SE2. SE2 will establish the easternmost battle position IVO LZ Vulture (within 300m of TH 829 774).  SE1 will establish the westernmost battle position IVO LZ Drake (within 300m of TH 805 759). ME will establish a center battle position IVO LZ Pheasant (within 300m of TH 822 777). The Co CP will be established IVO Port Upshur once all (3) platoon blocking positions are established.  
        (2) (U) Fire Support Plan.  


            (a) (U) Task.   Disrupt enemy forces


            (b) (U) Purpose.  Prevent enemy coordinated attacks on battle positions.


            (c) (U) Method.  We will use the BLTs 81mm mortars and the company’s 60mm mortars in support of the defense.  POF 81s is to ME, SE2, and SE 1. POF for 60s is SE1, ME, and SE2.  Platoon Commanders are allocated three targets for your defense including (1) FPF.  Platoon commanders will coordinate FPF with CO FiST.  Company Target Block is: 1st Plt: AE1000-1095, 3d Plt: AE3000-3095, 5th Plt: AE5000-5095.


            (d). (U) Effects. Enemy forces neutralized.

        (3) (U) Lost Marine Plan: TBD by Platoon Commander.


        (4) (U) UAS Support. Plan for a dedicated UAS asset (Raven) to provide aerial reconnaissance in support of your defensive scheme of maneuver. Planning considerations include: Flight time per asset: 30 minutes, Weather limitations
            (a) (U) Flight Time: 30 minutes per flight window. 
            (b) (U) Weather limitations: Flight availability dependent on precipitation, cloud coverage and wind.


            (c) (U) Availability: UAS Support will be available as indicated by COC each day.


(d) (U) Airspace: Airspace use and de-confliction with adjacent platoons will occur through the Company 
COC via green gear, or in person by request, one hour prior to requested flight time window.


(e) (U) Priority: (2) UAS Operators will co-locate with the company COC at Port Upshur. Priority of UAS 
asset will be determined by number of operational assets on hand and company commander’s discretion/rotation of priority (Priority: ME, SE1, SE2). Limited to (2) flight windows per day.


        (5) (U) Direction of Defense: Generally South. 


        (6) (U) Air Planning Considerations.  Prepare 15 Marine stick manifests. MV22s are capable of holding (3) sticks.


        (7) (U) Priorities of Work: Platoon commanders will develop their specific priorities of work.  NLT 2 hours after occupation on D – Day, I expect platoons to report over Company Tac, at a minimum: 8 Digit Grids of Left, Center and Right most positions of the platoon BP primary positions; grid azimuth of LLL, RLL, MMGs PDF or FPL and FSP with updated targets for platoon BP. NLT 0500 the following day, I expect primary, alternate and supplementary positions established and reported to higher.  Upon occupation, I expect platoon commanders to emplace LP/OPs and conduct patrol operations to support the Company’s defensive operation.  Platoon Commander’s should deconflict patrol and LP/OP operations with adjacent platoons IOT effectively build depth within the AO. Company COC will serve as a backstop and will battle track platoon operations.  As platoons update positions, targets and continue to develop their EA, report all updates to the company COC.


       (8) (U) MOPP Level.  MOPP Ready.  Intel reports enemy has used a blood agent in the past and is currently capable of employing a blood agent.  


       (9) (U) Rules of Engagement.  Individuals carrying a weapon are NOT declared hostile. Engage only Hostile Forces and Combatants. A Hostile Force is any civilian, paramilitary, or military force or terrorists, with or without national designation, that has committed a hostile act, exhibited hostile intent, or has been declared hostile by appropriate U.S. authority. Hostile forces may also be called Enemy Combatants. Hostile Act (HA): an attack or other use of force against U.S. forces. Some examples of possible hostile intent are an individual burying a suspicious cylinder along a road (likely improvised explosive device), an unknown armed group massing in your area of operation, or an unknown vehicle speeding to catch up with your convoy. Positive Identification (PID)* is required to engage. *Positive Identification (PID): A reasonable certainty that your target is a legitimate military target. *PID does not require 100% certainty. You must have clear line of sight to target and know what is behind it.
