SUBJ/2024 THANKSGIVING MESSAGE// 
 
RMKS/1.  America's Warfighting Navy: as we celebrate Thanksgiving this year, 
MCPON Honea and I want to express our sincere thanks to each and every one of 
you.  There is no doubt that our Navy-Marine Corps team has been in high 
demand this past year, and we could not be more proud of all we have 
accomplished around the world. 
 
2.  In the Middle East and Mediterranean, our teams are delivering decisive 
combat power and knocking down airborne threats at a rate not seen since 
World War II.  In the Indo-Pacific, our Warfighters are defending the rules-
based international order and upholding regional security and stability 
alongside our Allies and partners. 
In the Atlantic, the Baltic, and the High North, our Navy continues to work 
alongside NATO and other partner Navies to deter Russian aggression.  And in 
the Southern Seas, our Fleet is operating on the maritime frontlines, forging 
partnerships with other like-minded nations and delivering power for peace. 
Every day, our Navy team has lived up to our legacy, operating far forward to 
deter aggression, respond in crisis, and be ready to fight and win 
decisively, if called. 
 
3.  Today we give thanks for our shipmates and fellow servicemembers standing 
the watch and we give thanks to our families and broader support networks for 
their own service and sacrifice.  We cannot do what we do every day without 
their support and encouragement. 
 
4.  This Thanksgiving, no matter where you are, we hope you find the time to 
connect with family, friends, and shipmates, and reflect and give thanks. 
Please remember that holidays like this can be a challenging time for some of 
our shipmates. Look out for each other and continue to help our people 
connect their dot to our mission. 
 
5.  The U.S. Navy remains the world's preeminent fighting force, and we are 
grateful for the work you, our active and reserve Sailors and civilians, do 
every day to make it that way. 
 
6.  Happy Thanksgiving, Team Navy! We are honored to serve alongside you. 
 
7.  Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, 33rd Chief of Naval Operations 
and MCPON J. M. Honea, 16th Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.

SUBJ/NAVY UNIFORM POLICY AND UNIFORM INITIATIVE UPDATE FEBRUARY 2024// 
 
REF/A/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/23AUG21// 
 
AMPN/REF A IS NAVPERS 15665J, U.S. NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS. 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces updates to Navy uniform policies 
for calendar year 2024.  These policy updates are the result of 
Sailor feedback, command sponsored requests and direction from Navy 
leadership. 
 
2.  The following Navy uniform policy changes are effective 
immediately: 
    a.  Female Combination Cover.  The female combination cover, 
also referred to as the bucket cover, is reinstated as an optional 
Navy uniform component for female Sailors (E-1 through O-10) when 
wearing Service Dress and Dinner Dress Uniforms.  The bucket cover 
is now also optional for female officers and chief petty officers 
(CPOs) when wearing Service Khaki and Summer White Uniforms.  Note: 
the bucket cover will not be available for personal purchase at Navy 
Exchange Uniform Centers and will need to be privately obtained if 
desired for wear. 
    b.  Tiara.  The tiara is reinstated as an optional Navy uniform 
component for all female Sailors (E-1 through O-10) when wearing 
Dinner Dress Blue and White Jacket Uniforms.  Note: the tiara will 
be available for personal purchase as a special order item via Navy 
Exchange Online Customer Service with a lead time of approximately 
four weeks. 
    c.  Physical Training Uniform.  Black or navy-blue 
leggings/tights are authorized for optional wear with the Physical 
Training Uniform shorts and fitness suit pants. 
    d.  Grooming, False Eyelashes.  Female Sailors are authorized to 
wear false eyelashes or eyelash extensions that project a natural 
appearance and are no longer than 14 millimeters in length as 
measured from the eyelid to the tip of the eyelash.  False eyelash 
color will match the color of the natural eyelash.  Eyelash 
extensions cannot hinder wear of protective eyewear. 
    e.  Officer Headgear Cap Insignia.  Warrant Officer One Officers 
(W-1) will no longer wear the unique W-1 cap device.  All officers 
(W-1 through O-10) will wear the same officer cap insignia 
consisting of two gold crossed fouled anchors with burnished silver 
shield surmounted by a burnished silver eagle facing to wearer's 
right and may be embroidered or made of metal.  While allowed 
immediately, in order to allow time for W-1 officers to transition 
this new policy becomes mandatory on 1 October 2024. 
    f.  Chaplain Religious Faith Emblem (Chaplain Staff Corps 
Insignia).  Navy Chaplains are authorized to wear religious faith 
emblems above their grade insignia on uniform components with rank 
tabs.  The religious faith emblem is a 1 1/2-inch by 1 1/2-inch 
black patch with gold embroidered chaplain corps insignia centered 
on the fabric and positioned upright.  When worn, the religious 
faith emblem will be sewn or affixed to the uniform using a velcro 
fastener directly above the rank tab. 
    g.  Surface Chaplain Officer Qualification (SCO) Insignia.  Navy 
Chaplains assigned to qualifying afloat units who meet qualification 
criteria are authorized wear of the SCO breast insignia on Navy 
uniforms.  Wear of the SCO will be in accordance with reference (a). 
The SCO may be metal or embroidered.  The SCO insignia design 
consists of the bow-on aspect of a warship on a background of ocean 
swells and scroll banner underneath displaying the Navy Chaplain 
motto, Vocati Ad Servitium. 
    h.  Aerial Vehicle Pilot (AVP) Warfare Qualification Insignia 
(Officer).  Chief Warrant Officers and Warrant Officers (737X) 
successfully completing prescribed training requirements are 
authorized to wear the AVP breast insignia on Navy uniforms in 
accordance with reference (a).  The AVP insignia consists of a 
silver bordered gold shield, a delta pointing downward, crossed 
fouled anchors and stylized wings. 
    i.  Female T-Shirts.  All female Sailors are authorized to 
optionally wear T-shirts specifically designed for female bodies 
with Navy uniforms.  Female t-shirts will conform to Navy's 
requirement for color, fabric, and neck configuration (e.g., crew 
neck, v-neck) per reference (a).  The intent of this policy update 
is to address expressed dissatisfaction regarding the required wear 
of male or unisex t-shirts that are not designed to fit female 
bodies. 
    j.  Personal Appearance.  The restriction on placing hands in 
pockets while in uniform is rescinded.  Sailors are authorized to 
have hands in their pockets when doing so does not compromise safety 
nor prohibit the proper rendering of honors and courtesies. 
    k.  Backpacks.  Commercially procured coyote brown backpacks are 
authorized for optional wear with the NWU Type II and III.  Coyote 
brown backpacks will be worn in accordance with reference (a). 
 
3.  Ongoing Navy uniform initiatives: 
    a.  Maternity Pilot Program (MPP).  The MPP is successfully 
entering its third year of providing participating Sailors free 
uniforms ready for wear at their doorstep.  Since the program 
commenced in 2022, over 1300 Sailors have participated in the 
program.  During 2024, the program will continue to provide pregnant 
Sailors the option to choose from four maternity sea bag variations 
encompassing all maternity uniforms and a cardigan sweater with 
alterations and applicable accoutrements attached.  For more 
information about the program visit 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/US-Navy-Uniforms/Maternity-Pilot-
Program/. 
    b.  Size Modernization Program (SMP).  The SMP is a multiphase, 
five-year uniform improvement program with an initial focus on 
female uniform improvements.  The objective of the SMP is to deliver 
Navy Sailors with a modernized and consistent uniform fit and sizing 
system. 
    c.  Female Officer/CPO Summer White Uniform.  A white overblouse 
is being added to the list of authorized optional uniforms for the 
female officer and CPO Summer White Uniform.  The new overblouse is 
the first line of components delivered by the SMP.  Availability of 
the Summer White Uniform overblouse is planned for early fall 2024. 
A dress white overblouse is also being developed as an optional 
component for the female officer and CPO Service Dress Blue Uniform 
with estimated introduction after calendar year 2024. 
    d.  Female Service Uniform Slacks.  The Navy is currently 
evaluating service uniform slacks with back pockets for females. 
The focus of the evaluation is to determine the functionality and 
acceptability of female uniform slacks with back pockets.  If the 
evaluation to include Sailor feedback is determined to be positive, 
the future design of female slacks will include back pockets. 
    e.  Uniform Surveys.  Uniform surveys will be distributed 
throughout 2024 to continue to capture Fleet-wide input.  Surveys 
have been determined as the best method for the Uniform Matters 
Office to capture diverse and unbridled Sailor feedback that is 
crucial to planning, research and execution of uniform improvements 
and uniform and grooming policy updates.  Surveys will be announced 
on the Uniform Matters and MyNavy HR websites.  Access to surveys 
will be via QR codes or hyperlinks posted on the Uniform Matters and 
MyNavy HR websites. 
    f.  Hat Liners.  The Navy Exchange Service Command is adding 
synthetic liners to their list of uniform accessories for the Navy 
Working Uniform (NWU) eight-point cover.  The purpose of synthetic 
hat liners is to address Sailors' expressed concerns regarding 
unwanted hair removal or loss resulting from donning and doffing the 
NWU eight-point cover.  The liner will be sold separately and must 
be sewn into the cover for proper placement and wear.  Availability 
is expected to commence mid-February 2024 at most major Fleet 
concentration areas and online via https://www.mynavyexchange.com/.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) Cybersecurity Awareness Challenge (CAC) training 
requirement. 
 
2.  Per references (b) and (c), Navy personnel, civilians, and contractors 
with access to unclassified or classified networks must complete the 
Department of Defense (DoD) employee version of CAC by 1 September 2025. 
 
3.  Personnel who completed CAC 2024 after 30 September 2024 but before CAC 
2025 version is available, will receive credit for their annual FY25 
training. 
 
4.  Total Workforce Management Services (TWMS) is the readiness platform used 
to track CAC completion percentages for the Navy.  Commands and training 
platforms must confirm TWMS is capturing all CAC completions under the 
overarching requirement ID set by CNIC/TWMS Administration (TWMS Requirement 
ID: 76689 FY25 DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge) to receive credit.  Commands 
are prohibited from creating additional CAC training requirements to set 
command specific training metrics.  This requirement cannot be waived.  The 
options below are the authorized methods for training delivery: 
    a.  Commands can elect to complete CAC training using instructor-led 
    delivery.  A command designated cyber security professional such as the 
    Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) or Cyber Workforce Program 
Manager(CWF-PM) must provide the instruction. 
    b.  Total Workforce Management Service(TWMS), https://twms.dc3n.navy.mil; 
 
    c.  Navy e-Learning (NEL), https://learning.nel.navy.mil/;  
(Note:  The My Navy Portal, https://learning.nel.navy.mil/ELIAASv2p/  
redirects users to the NEL link)); 
    d.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) 
website, https://cyber.mil/training/cyber-awareness-challenge/; 
    e.  Waypoints, https://don.csod.com; 
    f.  Other approved training sources, DISA Digital Video Discs (DVDs). 
 
5.  Ships can access the annual training from the NEL application hosted on 
the Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) server, eliminating 
the need to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites.  The CAC 2025 course is 
available via the NEL Afloat Learning Management System Pub Amendment 112 for 
download by the NIAPS Administrator using the normal manual NIAPS distance 
support update process.  If unable to download Learning Management System Pub 
Amendment 112, ships can request a DVD with these files to be mailed by 
submitting a support request to Navy 311. 
 
6.  Although CAC training is an individual responsibility, commanders and 
commanding officers are accountable for completion by 100 percent of their 
personnel.  Effective 1 September 2020, the DoD Cybersecurity Hardening 
Scorecard collects information on the number of users who completed annual 
Cybersecurity Awareness training and the scorecard is briefed on a quarterly 
basis to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Training officers are responsible 
for ensuring their personnel complete and properly document the required 
training. 
 
7.  Command training officers must validate training via TWMS or Fleet 
Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS) 
(https//ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/fltmps/) authoritative databases. Training 
officers will manually record training completed via the DISA website, DISA 
DVDs, or instructor-led.  Manually record training in FLTMPS using the 
Learning Event Completion Form.  Report any discrepancies to the Navy 
Training Management Planning System Operational Support office at 
ntmps.support(AT)navy.mil or 1-866-438-2898/DSN 922-1867. 
 
8.  The Command ISSM is responsible for reporting compliance to meet Federal 
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requirements.  Command ISSMs 
will disable accounts of users who do not complete training by 1 September 
2025 and maintain non-compliance list of accounts that were disabled. 
 
9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

SUBJ/CNO BIRTHDAY MESSAGE TO THE FLEET// 
 
1.  America's Warfighting Navy, it's time to reflect on our rich naval 
history as we celebrate our 249th Birthday - 249 years of Navy 
"Warfighting Strength and Readiness." 
 
2.  The birth of our Navy came nearly a year before our Nation's 
independence.  On October 13, 1775, during the early months of the 
Revolutionary War, our bold and daring Continental Sailors set sail for 
Boston to deliver America its first dose of Warfighting Advantage.  From that 
point on, there was no turning back.  The Great American Experiment was truly 
underway and with it the legacy of our United States Navy. 
 
3.  Over the centuries, battles, and wars since, our Navy Sailors have 
continued to deliver Warfighting Advantage, always ready to preserve the 
peace, respond in crisis, and win decisively in war, if called. 
 
4.  From the Eastern Mediterranean to the Indo-Pacific and everywhere in 
between, our Sailors have been standing the watch, around the world and 
around the clock, in every domain from seabed to space, and in cyberspace.   
No other Navy in the world can train, deploy, and sustain such a lethal and 
combat credible force at the pace, scale, and tempo we do.  All of this has 
been made possible by you, America's Warfighting Navy.  Each one of you plays 
a critical role in our Fleet.  You are truly our secret weapon. 
 
5.  As we look to the future and the decisive decade ahead, we know that our 
team will continue to answer our Nation's call and build on our Navy's legacy 
with Honor, Courage, and Commitment. 
 
6.  We could not be more proud of each and every one of you, our active and 
reserve Sailors and Navy civilians who contribute to our Navy's success every 
day.  Please extend our thanks to your families for their own service and 
sacrifice.  We could not do what we need to do every day without their love 
and support. 
 
7.  Happy 249th Birthday, Shipmates.  See you in the Fleet. 
 
8.  Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations and 
MCPON J. M. Honea, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
